[Verse 1]
There’s a silencing
As the machine arrives here
I feel it pulling me
I feel the past that's died here
I hear it calling me
"You can come alive here"
I hear it beckoning
Until I am inside

[Chorus]
Riding the horizon
Falling into you
Feel the vessel tighten
I feel you pull me through
A new world is breaking
Your heart unveiling
Breaking into pieces
In the gravity of you
In the gravity of you

[Verse 2]
I see the empty dreams
Race across the sky here
I see energy streams
Where the ashes lie here
I feel you here with me
When all the hope has died here
It’s boring holes in me
Enough to get inside

[Chorus]
Riding the horizon
Falling into you
Feel the vessel tighten
I feel you pull me through
A new world is breaking
Your heart unveiling
Breaking into pieces
In the gravity of you
In the gravity of you

[Bridge]
To fall in the star is to be nothingness
To escape is to be empty
Fall into the star and then we won't exist
Or escape into the nothing
To fall in the star is to be nothingness
To escape is to be empty
Fall into the star and then we won't exist
Or escape into the nothing
Your sky
The beauty alone is worth it
I, I will risk it all to own it

[Chorus]
Riding the horizon
Falling into you
Feel the vessel tighten
I feel you pull me through
A new world is breaking
Your heart unveiling
Breaking into pieces
In the gravity of you
In the gravity of you[Intro]
There's a memory of how we used to be
That I can see through the flames
I am hypnotized as I fantasize
Forgetting lies and pain
But I can't go back

[Pre-Chorus]
The ashes call my name

[Chorus]
Pouring the fuel, fanning the flames
Breaking the habit and melting the chains
Embracing the fear, chasing the fight
The glow of the fire will light up the night
The bridges are burning, the heat's on my face
Making the past an unreachable place
Pouring the fuel, fanning the flames
I know this is the point of no return

[Verse 2]
It's uncontrollable, such a beautiful desire
There's something sinister about the way it hurts
When I watch it burn (Higher and higher)
Because I can't go back

[Pre-Chorus]
The ashes call my name

[Chorus]
Pouring the fuel, fanning the flames
Breaking the habit and melting the chains
Embracing the fear, chasing the fight
The glow of the fire will light up the night
The bridges are burning, the heat's on my face
Making the past an unreachable place
Pouring the fuel, fanning the flames
I know this is the point of no return

[Bridge]
I won't turn around
I won't turn around
I won't turn around

[Chorus]
Pouring the fuel, fanning the flames
Breaking the habit and melting the chains
Embracing the fear, chasing the fight
The glow of the fire will light up the night
The bridges are burning, the heat's on my face
Making the past an unreachable place
Pouring the fuel, fanning the flames
I know this is the point of no return
This is the point of no return
This is the point of no return[Verse 1]
I cut you into pieces
Searching for your imperfections
I had plans to make you whole
But all my threads couldn't stop the bleeding
There's nothing left, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

[Chorus]
I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way, then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

[Verse 2]
Your eyes stare right through me
Ignoring my failed attempts to
Breathe back life into your veins
But I can't start your cold heart beating
You're so far gone, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

[Chorus]
I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way, then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

[Bridge]
And you left me more dead
Than you'll ever know
When you left me alone

[Chorus]
I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way, then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

[Outro]
Let it die
Let it die
Let it die
Let it die[Verse 1]
Mayday! Mayday!
This ship is slowly sinking
They think I'm crazy but they don't know the feeling
They're all around me
Circling like vultures
They wanna break me and wash away my colors
Wash away my colors

[Chorus]
Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay
(''Kay, okay, okay)
We are one and the same
Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away
(Way, away, away)
Save me if I become
My demons

[Verse 2]
I cannot stop this sickness taking over
It takes control and drags me into nowhere
I need your help, I can't fight this forever
I know you're watching
I can feel you out there

[Chorus]
Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay
('Kay, okay, okay)
We are one and the same
Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away
(Way, away, away)
Save me if I become
My demons

[Bridge]
Take me over the walls below
Fly forever
Don't let me go
I need a savior to heal my pain
When I become my worst enemy
The enemy

[Interlude]
Take me high and I'll sing
You make everything okay
We are one and the same
You take all of the pain away

[Chorus]
Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay
('Kay, okay, okay)
We are one and the same
Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away
(Way, away, away)
Save me if I become
My demons
Take me high and I'll sing
Oh you make everything okay, okay, okay
('Kay, okay, okay)
We are one and the same
Oh you take all of the pain away, away, away
(Way, away, away)
Save me if I become
My demons[Verse 1]
Even a well lit place, can hide salvation
A map to a one man maze that never sees the sun
Where the lost are the heroes
And the thieves are left to drown
But everyone knows by now
Fairy-tales are not found
They are written in the walls

[Chorus]
As we walk in a straight line
Down in the dirt with a landslide approaching
But nothing could ever stop us
From stealing our own place in the sun
We will face the odds against us
And run into the fear we run from (ah, ah)
It has begun

[Verse 2]
Into the dark below
Evading shadows
Blind in a rabbit's hole
We fall beneath the earth
And watch the shell come unraveled
As the seed begins to rise
Embracing a starlit fate as we wait in the night
It's written in the walls

[Chorus]
As we walk in a straight line
Down in the dirt with a landslide approaching
But nothing could ever stop us
From stealing our own place in the sun
We will face the odds against us
And run into the fear we run from (ah, ah)

[Outro]
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)All my life they let me know
How far I would not go
But inside the beast still grows
Waiting
Chewing through the ropes

Who are you to change this world?
Silly Boy!
No one needs to hear your words
Let it go

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Won't you come digest me?
Take away everything I am
Bring it to an end
Carnivore! Carnivore!
Could you come and change me?
Take away everything I am
Everything I am!

I will hide myself below
I'll be what you wanted
Kept inside I won't let go
'Till I burn beyond control

Who are you to change this world?
Silly Boy!
No one needs to hear your words
Let it go

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Won't you come digest me?
Take away everything I am
Bring it to an end
Make me fall. Make me bleed
Go ahead and change me!
Take away everything I am
Everything I am!

Never enough
(Who I am is not good enough)
Never enough
(Who I am)

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Won't you come digest me?
Take away everything I am
Bring it to an end
Carnivore! Carnivore!
Could you come and change me?
Take away everything I am
Everything I am![Verse 1]
Under the knife I surrendered
The innocence yours to consume
You cut it away
And you filled me up with hate
Into the silence you sent me
Into the fire consumed
You thought I’d forget
But it’s always in my head

[Chorus]
You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
You're the love that I hate
You're the drug that I take
Will you cage me?
Will you cage me?
You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
From the monster you made me?
The monster you made me?

[Verse 2]
This is the world you've created
The product of what I've become
My soul and my youth
Seems it's all for you to use
If I could take back the moment
I let you get under my skin
Relent or resist?
Seems the monster always wins

[Chorus]
You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
You're the love that I hate
You're the drug that I take
Will you cage me?
Will you cage me?
You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
From the monster you made me?
The monster you made me?

[Bridge]
My heart's an artifice, a decoy soul
I'll lift you up and then I'll let you go
I've made an art of digging shallow holes
I drop the darkness in and watch it grow
My heart's an artifice, a decoy soul
Who knew the emptiness could be so cold?
I've lost the parts of me that make me whole
I am the darkness
I'm a monster

[Chorus]
You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
You're the love that I hate
You're the drug that I take
Will you cage me?
Will you cage me?
You're the pulse in my veins
You're the war that I wage
Can you change me?
Can you change me?
From the monster you made me?
The monster you made me?
The monster you made me?
The monster you made me?[Verse 1]
And I fly
Further away
Than I've ever been before
It's safe to say

This sky
Is lonely and grey
But every night I feel your gravity waves

[Bridge]
And the world is cold
But it's beautiful
I wish you were here now
I miss your soul
But you lost your light
When the darkness called
But I stand here waiting

[Chorus]
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall

[Verse 2]
And I fly
Above the enslaved
My soul is burning
Like an earth reclaimed

And I try
A final crusade
This world is changing
But I'm still the same

[Bridge]
And will you be bold
Will you lose control?
I could never desert you
I could never let go
And if you fall in line
And the zenith calls
I'm standing waiting

[Chorus ]
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall

[Middle 8]
It's your magnetic hold
A gravity pull
I can feel you in waves
When your melody comes
It falls from above
I will not be afraid

[Chorus]
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall
The last to fall[Verse 1]
And if I had my way
I would run to the rescue
It never works that way
When you call a bluff
Oh, all the fools rush in
It's a battle to surround you
And all the fools want in
But I'm not giving up

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna let you go
But I can't stand to watch this
I don't wanna let you know
But you can read my mind

[Chorus]
I feel it all the time
Felt it all around you
You had me under spell right from the start
I don't have a telepathic heart
Telepathic
Blind, I fall into the line
That's waiting just to get you
But I don't ever know just what we are
I don't have a telepathic heart
Telepathic

[Verse 2]
Look inside my brain
You know what I want before I tell you
Give me the words to say to make it enough
Don't want your star-crossed fate
You are the sun, I am the full moon
Don't leave me lost in vain
I can be what you want

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna let you go
But I can't stand to watch this
I don't wanna let you know
But you can read my mind

[Chorus]
I feel it all the time
Felt it all around you
You had me under spell right from the start
I don't have a telepathic heart
Telepathic
Blind, I fall into the line
That's waiting just to get you
But I don't ever know just what we are
I don't have a telepathic heart
Telepathic
Telepathic
Telepathic

[Bridge]
And you always turn away
Back to the start where I break through
You can run, you can run away
I will wait in the dark for you
Should've never fell this way
Cause you're the sun and I'm just a moon
I'm in the dark 'till you light the way
Cause I'm see through
You can read my mind

[Chorus]
I feel it all the time
Felt it all around you
You had me under spell right from the start
I don't have a telepathic heart
Telepathic
Blind, I fall into the line
That's waiting just to get you
But I don't ever know just what we are
I don't have a telepathic heart
Telepathic
Telepathic
Telepathic[Verse 1]
Stardust
In you and in me
Fuse us
Into unity
Primeval
We're coupled
Born from the universe

Farewell
The void is calling
Don't fear
For futures and dreams
They're fleeting, retreating
It's ok. I promise

[Chorus]
I don't know what to say
But I'm going to want you till the stars evaporate
We're only here for just a moment in the light
One day it shines for us the next we're in the night
So say the word and I'll be running back to find you
A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through
I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight
Of your starlight

[Verse 2]
Tell me
Just tell me to stay
I'll turn
I won't look away
I'll stay here
I'll never go but you don't feel the same

Farewell
Farewell and godspeed
Light years
Between you and me
I'm fading
Your beauty conquers the darkness

[Chorus]
At night the earth will rise
And I'll think of you each time I watch from distant skies
Whenever stars go down and galaxies ignite
I'll think of you each time they wash me in their light
And I'll fall in love with you again
I will find you
A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through
I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight of your starlight

[Bridge]
Don't leave me lost here forever
Show me your starlight and pull me through
Don't leave me lost here forever
I need your starlight and pull me through
Bring me back to you

[Chorus]
At night the earth will rise
And I'll think of you each time I watch from distant skies
Whenever stars go down and galaxies ignite
I'll think of you each time they wash me in their light
And I'll fall in love with you again
I will find you
A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through
I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight of your starlight[Intro]
I was scanning through the skies
And missed the static in your eyes
Something blocking your reception
It's distorting our connection
With the distance amplified
Was it all just synthesized?
And now the silence screams that you are gone
You've tuned me out
I've lost your frequency

[Verse 1]
There's something here that’s broken
There's something here with no end
It's paralyzed
It's in your eyes
'Cause I can feel your soul fade
I can feel your heart change
It falls out of phase with mine
While you oscillate inside
Or is it only in my head?

[Chorus]
I was scanning through the skies
And missed the static in your eyes
Something blocking your reception
It's distorting our connection
With the distance amplified
Was it all just synthesized?
And now the silence screams that you are gone
You've tuned me out
I've lost your frequency

[Verse 2]
Left inside a half-life
Irradiated insides
These memories
They never leave
I bared my soul for you and all I got was static
My heart was bulletproof till you took off the jacket

[Chorus]
I was scanning through the skies
And missed the static in your eyes
Something blocking your reception
It's distorting our connection
With the distance amplified
Was it all just synthesized?
And now the silence screams that you are gone
You've tuned me out
I've lost your frequency

(Your frequency...)

[Bridge]
Castaway
My cries are blocked by the horizon
Suffocate
I was doing this all for you
I'm in the shallows
Stuck in the gallows
I tried to save you now I'm swallowed
You wanted war
I am the war
I alone

[Outro]
Something blocking your reception
It's distorting our connection
With the distance amplified
Was it all just synthesized?
And now the silence screams that you are gone
You've tuned me out
I've lost your frequency

I'll cast the first stone (first stone, first stone)
I'll cast the first stone (first stone, first stone)
Just to take the attention away from me
Anything to protect my reputation
Because I feel like that's all I have, all I know

What do I look like in their eyes?
Is it something desirable?
Or am I nothing?

What do I look like in their eyes?
What do I look like in their eyes?

I'll cast the first stone
Like I am the last one to blame
Just to shift their condemning eyes away
I'll cast the first stone
Like I am the last one to blame
Just to break their denouncing gaze

Why should I wait to hear their verdict?
Why do I care about who they think I should be?
Why should I wait to hear their verdict?
Why do I care about who they think I should be?

I have been bending over backwards for every reason but the right one
I have placed value on things that don't deserve it

Now what do I look like to those who matter?
Why did I waste all this time on the temporary?
It's too easy to take the wrong things to heart
Especially from those who seem to have misplaced their own

I won't say that I'll never cast another stone
Or that I am the last one to blame
But I want to stop living like anyone else's opinion
Of who I should be is a regulation in my life

I shouldn't forget there's a difference
Between living for other's approval and just living for othersAll the lights
Were too bright to see the spark
That I've been missing for too long
Something I've been missing for too long

My empty cup
Could never fill another
I have spilled all I've had
To make things better
But the love of all others
Has made me new

My empty cup
Could never (because of you) fill another
(I am made new) I have spilled all I've had
(because of you) to make things better. (I am made new)

We've all been broken
So let us make each other new
We've all been broken
So let us make each other new

I've died inside every time I tried
To lie to myself about feeling alive, alive
(I've died)
I've died inside every time I tried
To lie to myself about feeling alive, alive
(I've died)

All the lights
Were too bright to see the spark
That I've been missing for too long
Something I've been missing for too long

All these distractions
Kept me from seeing what I needed all along
An understanding

I am speechless tonight
As I stare into the sky
I feel endless compassion, forgiveness, and love
I feel everyone who is looking up sharing this
I feel unexplainably alive

I need to understand what we've grown to be

Tonight, when I look into the sky
I know this is why I am alive
Tonight, when I look into the sky
I know this is why I am alive

So sing with me if you feel this feeling
So sing with me if you feel this feeling

Tonight, when I look into the sky
I know this is why I am alive
Tonight, when I look into the sky
I know this is why I am alive

So sing with me if you feel this feeling
So sing with me if you feel this feeling

I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive

Strangers they come, with the rise of the sun
To escape from this madness, forever!
Rivers run dry, ripping holes in the sky
As the empire is fading away

Silently march now, where the lost souls run wild
In a time long forgotten forever
Pain brings us sadness at the dawn of the world
But this nightmare will still carry on

Through the day we'll find a way, we're lost beneath the stars
Faceless they fall now and we all stand as one
Long wasted tears, but a light forever shining
One stand, one last demand to end it all

Outside the world in the Fallen Land, turn away from my despair
We stand alone in a silent dream, lost within eternally
Whoa-oh! Whoa-oh!
Rise again and try to understand!

A light for the world will save us tonight
Redemption's still so far away
Marching on inside of our loneliness
Still searching for all that remains

And time will pass me by, but I'm not so far away
We're the sons of the land; our lifeblood runs into the ocean
Tomorrow we're gone, our souls rising up to the sun

A light for the world will save us tonight
Redemption's still so far away
Marching on inside of our loneliness
Still searching for all that remains

It's just one wasted man in one wasted land
Suffering, still burning, so alive
It's just one wasted man, in one wasted land
Until the end of time—inside the Winter Storm!

Outside the world in the Fallen Land, turn away from our despair
We stand alone in a silent dream, lost within eternally
Whoa-oh! Whoa-oh!
Rise again and try to understand!

A light for the world will save us tonight
Redemption's still so far away
Marching on inside of our loneliness
Still searching for all that remains

It's just one wasted man, in one wasted land
Suffering, still burning, so alive
It's just one wasted man, in one wasted land
Until the end of time—inside the Winter Storm!

Inside the Winter Storm!Reckless wheel of time
We follow how it flies by
We still keep believing
In white and comforting lies

When it's our turn
Together we stay stronger
We lay still and silent
And watch how our world burns for eternity

You carry me away
'Til 'morrow we're unbreakable
I hold my breath and wait
This moment is unbreakable
I can feel it deep within my heart and my soul
You make me whole
I want to live this second forever
Always together, forevermore
I hold my breath and wait

Reckless wheel of life
We see how years keep flying by
I never really cared
Until I opened my eyes

The final day awaits
And the firestorm's getting closer
Under falling stars
We will seal our fate for eternity

You carry me away
'Til 'morrow we're unbreakable
I hold my breath and wait
This moment is unbreakable
I can feel it deep within my heart and my soul
You make me whole
I want to live this second forever
Always together, forevermore
I hold my breath and wait 'til the end
Until 'morrow we're unbreakable

You carry me away
'Til 'morrow we're unbreakable
I hold my breath and wait
This moment is unbreakable
I can feel it deep within my heart and my soul
You make me whole
I want to live this second forever
Always together, forevermore

We are stronger than ever
Always together, forevermore
We are stronger than ever
Always together, forevermore
I hold my breath and wait 'til the end
Until 'morrow we're unbreakable[Verse 1]
Traces of your voice
I know it, I know it so well
Waking in the storm
I can feel you, I can feel you with me
Can I go again?
Oh, your reckless, your reckless love goes
I cannot defend
This untamed heart is waiting

[Chorus]
I am standing on the edge
Take me over, take me over
See how fast this life can change
Take me further, lead me further
Take me over, take me over

[Verse 2]
Find my life ahead
Oh, I don’t know, I don’t know where
But I’m starting on my way
Will you meet me, will you meet me there?
Echoes in the night
Like a melody is haunting me
But then I meet your eyes
With the fire of a rising sun

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Do you believe a life can change?
Take me over, take me over

[Chorus][Verse 1]
Now it falls all around me
Did I think I could run away
Now it’s coming to find me
This war that I deserve
Now it burns across this shattered earth
I lift my eyes to fire

[Chorus]
Under a falling sky
Hopeless, there’s nowhere to hide
The terror is real this time
Under a falling sky
I’m under, I’m under
A falling sky

[Verse 2]
There you are, so far away
Did you think I was fighting you
I only wanted to carry you so far away from here
The nightmare bleeds
The poison seeps
I hear you call
You’re screaming, screaming

[Chorus]
Under a falling sky
Hopeless, there’s nowhere to hide
The terror is real this time
Under a falling sky
I’m under, I’m under
A falling sky

[Bridge]
My fate it rains, it rains like cinders
The cadent drums, the war it comes
Growing thunder, terror, wonder
Falling, falling
It’s falling, falling

Under a falling sky
The terror is real this time
It’s over now, it’s over
The terror is real

[Chorus][Verse 1]
And we were bold
Over the world
We were flying through the satellites
We had ahold
Of the lightning strikes
When we should have been afraid of heights
And I was trying just to get you
And now I'm dying to forget you
Cause I knew I couldn't catch you
So I left the sky
And I fell behind

[Chorus]
We were one in the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
We were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet

[Verse 2]
If I was whole
I'd turn right now
I'd forget it and just walk away
Cause I've been told
That I'm dragging it out
But I've been dying just to see your face
And all I wanted was to say "goodbye"
Into the fortress that you're stuck behind
And in the silence now I realize
That after all I built the wall

[Chorus]
We were one in the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
You were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet

[Bridge]
All these broken souls
They never make me whole
They don't, they don't know my heart
They don't know my heart
All these broken souls
Each one more beautiful
They don't, they don't know my heart
They don't know my heart
I'll send out my soul
To worlds more beautiful
But they won't, they won't know my heart
It's the darkest part

[Chorus]
We were one in the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
You were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet

[Verse 1]
You've bought all the happiness
But you still want more
Parade all that you possess
Though there's no one keeping score
Dreaming of vertigo
From the highest fame
Feeling the undertow
When it starts to break

[Chorus]
Everything will fall away
Some day
All that's real is what remains
To always

[Verse 2]
A cage of the tangible
All you had to own
You poor social cannibal
What's left when you lose the throne?
We're of the same affair
Pride before the fall
We'll see what's truly there
When it takes us all

[Chorus]
Everything will fall away
Some day
All that's real is what remains
To always
Everything will fall away
Some day
All that's real is what remains
To always[Verse 1]
They tell you that you're staying here
In white walled observation
It's terminal or so they fear
Well-meaning resignation

[Pre-Chorus]
Whenever you feel that the world is a lie
A cruel and merciless hope homicide
You gotta fight it with everything you have inside

[Chorus]
You are a rockstar, a superhero
Get up, get up and show 'em what you're made of
You know what you are so let the fear go
Get up, get up and show 'em what you're made of

[Verse 2]
Adversity, a souvenir
To spark your transformation
Tenacity is growing near
And here's the inspiration

[Pre-Chorus]
Whenever you feel that the world is a lie
A cruel and merciless hope homicide
You gotta fight it with everything you have inside

You are a rockstar, a superhero
Get up, get up and show 'em what you're made of
You know what you are so let the fear go

You are a rockstar, a superhero
Get up, get up and show 'em what you're made of
You know what you are so let the fear go
Get up, get up and show 'em what you're made of[Verse 1: Bret Autrey]
I am the beast
I am the earth
I am the blood that fills the sky
I am the feast
Of famine, thirst
And every will to justify

My own war to take it head on

A temple to carnality
We are enmeshed
Sacred, profane
Reflected through brutality

My own war to take it head on
With every wrong and every right

Lost in the time
In the way, gone but not forgotten
New secret crimes
To repay, now the walls have fallen

[Pre-Chorus]
And so it's now or never

[Chorus]
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out
I'll cut the ties that hold me down
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out
I'll be the enemy

[Verse 2]
Caught quicksand grip
Pull me in, whisper faith in sickness
Soon kill the myth
I'll begin, be the first to witness

[Pre-Chorus]
And so it's now or never

I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out
I'll cut the ties that hold me down

[Verse 1]
A crumbling altar, how dim the glow
Buried it far below
Stumble and falter within the bone
As heaven is overthrown

[Pre-Chorus]
In every direction we're torn apart
So ineffectual

[Chorus]
Send the fire down
The sun consumes the ground
Wash it all away
In lakes of flame

[Verse 2]
Eternal horizon, salt the earth
Sever the nearest nerve

[Pre-Chorus]
A fading reflection to pierce the heart
Of what’s amendable

[Chorus]
Send the fire down
The sun consumes the ground
Wash it all away
In lakes of flame

Send the fire down

[Strophe 1]
Ich kannte viele schöne Damen
Auf dieser schönen, weiten Welt
Mit Fug und Recht kann man das sagen
Ich war ein wahrer Frauenheld
Man sagt mir nach, ich wäre schamlos
So herz- und lieblos und frivol
Man meint, ich hätte sie gezwungen
Nein, die Wahrheit liegt dazwischen wohl

[Refrain 1]
Denn ach so gern hab' ich die Frauen geküsst
Und doch nicht immer auf den Mund
Ich wollte immer wissen, wie es ist
Und küsste mir Lippen wund

[Strophe 2]
Ich küsste nicht nur rote Wangen
Ich hatte einfach alles lieb
Man sagt, ich sieche vor Verlangen
Besessen so von Paarungstrieb
Sie meinten, ich wär tief gefallen
In ein Meer von Libido
Man sagt, ich sieche vor Verlangen
Das kann man so seh'n oder so

[Refrain 2]
Denn ach so gern hab' ich die Frauen geküsst
Und doch nicht immer auf den Mund
Ich wollte immer wissen, wie es ist
Und küsste mir die Lippen bunt
Ich nahm sie einfach in die Arme
Und manche hauchte leise: „Nein“
Doch ich kannte kein Erbarmen
Am Ende sollten sie's bereuen

[Strophe 3]
Wie das Kaninchen vor der Schlange
Ein kalter Blick, dann biss ich zu
Und das Gift ruft ein Verlangen
Ließe nimmer mich in Ruh'
Ach, die Frauen, all die treuen
Und manches Herz brach wohl entzwei
Am Ende sollten sie's bereuen
So viele Tränen und Geschrei

[Refrain 3]
Denn ach so gern hab' ich die Frauen geküsst
Und das nicht immer auf den Mund
Ich wollte einfach wissen, wie es ist
Und küsste mir die Lippen wund
Ich nahm sie einfach in die Arme
Und manche hauchte leise: „Nein“
Doch ich kannte kein Erbarmen
Soll damit sie glücklich sein?

Schwebe so durch alle Räume
Keine Grenzen, keine Zäune

Hallo kleines Mädchen, wie geht es dir?
Mir geht es gut, sprich nicht zu mir
Steig einfach ein, ich nehm' dich mit
Und kaufe dir Muscheln mit Pommes Frites

Und hast das Meer noch nicht geseh'n
Du bist alleine, ich ganz allein

Wer zu Lebzeit gut auf Erden
Wird nach dem Tod ein Engel werden
Den Blick gen Himmel fragst du dann

Wir haben Angst und sind allein
Denn Gotte weiß ich will kein Engel sein

Sie leben hinterm Sonnenschein
Getrennt von uns unendlich weit
Sie müssen sich an Sterne krallen (Ganz fest)
Damit sie nicht vom Himmel fallen

Das Gleichgewicht wird zum Verlust
Lässt dich hart zu Boden gehen
Und die Welt zählt laut bis zehn

[Refrain]
Eins, hier kommt die Sonne
Zwei, hier kommt die Sonne
Drei, sie ist der hellste Stern von allen
Vier, und wird nie vom Himmel fallen
Fünf, hier kommt die Sonne
Sechs, hier kommt die Sonne
Sieben, sie ist der hellste Stern von allen
Acht, Neun, hier kommt die Sonne
Aus!

[Strophe 1]
Ich werde in die Tannen gehen
Dahin wo ich sie zuletzt gesehen
Doch der Abend wirft ein Tuch aufs Land
Und auf die Wege hinterm Waldesrand
Und der Wald er steht so schwarz und leer
Weh mir, oh weh, Und die Vögel singen nicht mehr

[Refrain]
Ohne dich kann ich nicht sein, Ohne dich
Mit dir bin ich auch allein (Ohne dich)
Ohne dich zähl ich die Stunden ohne dich
Mit dir stehen die Sekunden, Lohnen nicht

[Strophe 2]
Auf den Ästen in den Gräben
Ist es nun still und ohne Leben
Und das Atmen fällt mir ach so schwer
Weh mir, oh weh, Und die Vögel singen nicht mehr

[Refrain]
Ohne dich kann ich nicht sein, Ohne dich
Mit dir bin ich auch allein (Ohne dich)
Ohne dich zähl ich die Stunden ohne dich
Mit dir stehen die Sekunden, Lohnen nicht
Ohne dich
Ohne dich

[Bridge]
Und das Atmen fällt mir ach so schwer
Weh mir, oh weh, Und die Vögel singen nicht mehr

[Refrain]
Ohne dich kann ich nicht sein, Ohne dich
Mit dir bin ich auch allein (Ohne dich)
Ohne dich zähl ich die Stunden ohne dich
Mit dir stehen die Sekunden, Lohnen nicht
Ohne dich

[Outro]
Ohne dich
Ohne dich
Ohne dich
Ohne dich

[Intro: Viktoria Fersh]
Это песня о самом прекрасном
Городе в мире. Москва!

[Strophe 1: Till Lindemann and Viktoria Fersh]
Diese Stadt ist eine Dirne
Hat rote Flecken auf der Stirn
Ihre Zähne sind aus Gold
Sie ist fett und doch so hold
Ihr Mund fällt mir zu Tale
Wenn ich sie dafür bezahle
Sie zieht sich aus doch nur für Geld
Die Stadt die mich in Atem hält (Москва!)

[Refrain: Till and Viktoria]
Moskau
Раз, два, три!
Moskau
Посмотри!
Пионеры там и тут
Песни Ленину поют

[Strophe 2: Till and Viktoria]
Sie ist alt und trotzdem schön
Ich kann ihr nicht widerstehen (Не могу устоять)
Pudert sich die alte Haut
Hat sich die Brüste neu gebaut (Построила вновь)
Sie macht mich geil ich leide Qualen
Sie tanzt für mich ich muss bezahlen (Я должен платить)
Sie schläft mit mir doch nur für Geld
Ist doch die schönste Stadt der Welt (Поехали!)

[Refrain: Till and Viktoria]
Moskau
Раз, два, три!
Moskau
Посмотри!
Пионеры там и тут
Песни Ленину поют
Moskau
Раз, два, три!
Moskau
Посмотри!
Пионеры там и тут
Песни Ленину поют

[Post-Refrain: Till and Viktoria]
Москва!
Поехали, Москва!
Москва!
Раз, два, три!

[Bridge: Till, Viktoria and together]
Ich sehe was, was du nicht siehst
Когда ты ночью крепко спишь
Ich sehe was, was du nicht siehst
Когда ты предо мной лежишь
Ich sehe was, was du nicht siehst
Когда со мною говоришь
Ich sehe was, das siehst du nie
Раз, два, три!

[Refrain: Till, Viktoria and together]
Moskau
Раз, два, три!
Moskau
Посмотри!
Пионеры там и тут
Песни Ленину поют

Пионеры там и тут
Песни Ленину поют
Moskau
Раз, два, три!

Посмотри!
Пионеры там и тут
Песни Ленину поют (Москва!)
(Москва!)

[Intro]
These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are
We're motivated by the scars that we're made of
These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are
We take our places in the dark
And turn our hearts to the stars

[Verse 1]
Hear me from the bottom
Forged in regret, I'm the silversmith
Doomsday, you had it coming
Marching the streets with an iron fist
Obey no more in silence
The steel in our hearts will be monuments
Today, they'll hear the violence
We'll rise from the dark like Lazarus

[Chorus]
These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are
We're motivated by the scars that we're made of
These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are
We take our places in the dark
And turn our hearts to the stars

[Verse 2]
The ending won't be forgotten
It's written in the stars and the hieroglyphs
Sending the lionhearted
The stones break bones
But we're venomous

[Chorus]
These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are
We're motivated by the scars that we're made of
These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are
We take our places in the dark
And turn our hearts to the stars

[Bridge]
Calling, calling
We've come out to play
Show me, show me
A new way
Slowly, slowly
They've led you astray
Away we go now
Into the fray

[Chorus]
These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are
We're motivated by the scars that we're made of
These trials make us who we are, who we are, we are
We take our places in the dark
And turn our hearts to the stars

One night it happened
The morning never came
It has been snowing ever since
The plague of cold harvests the land
And only few still wait for the sun

[Chorus]
Cities are buried under white curse
Remains of the man lay on the glacial ground
The monuments of ice curve upon us
Leading our way to the bitter end

[Verse 2]
One night it happened
The morning never came
The clocks tick anew
This same hour of dark

And if we had only known
That it would last forever
We would have forgiven ourselves
And let the snow bury us together

[Verse 3]
One night it happened
The morning never came
Now it's been seven years ever since
The season of dark fell upon us
And only few still wait for the sun

[Chorus]
Cities are buried under white curse
Remains of the man lay on the glacial ground
The monuments of ice curve upon us
Leading our way to the bitter end

[Verse 2]
One night it happened
The morning never came
The clocks tick anew
This same hour of dark

And if we had only known

And let the snow bury us together

[Chorus]
Cities are buried under white curse
Remains of the man lay on the glacial ground
The monuments of ice curve upon us
Leading our way to the bitter end

[Verse 1]
My heart greeds for frozen stars
Deep black universe upon me
I'm enchanted by this warm light
Yet nothing can melt my cold soul

[Verse 2]
The lakes, my silent lovers
Whispers from the deep black waters
Ice would keep the ghost's silent
Their mournful song freezes my heart

[Chorus]
Come down where the embers burn
Let the night embrace you
And just before the morning haze
You will disappear without a trace

[Verse 3]
Seasons change but the sorrow stays
Symphony is getting louder day by day
When the fog raises the dead again
Disharmony of crushing bones
Will take away my pain

[Chorus]
Come down where the embers burn
Let the night embrace you
And just before the morning haze
You will disappear without a trace
You will disappear without a trace[Verse 1]
Please don't guide me again
Could you just leave me here?
I'll bury these wounds with you
I'll be gone by nightfall

[Verse 2]
The shadow is gone
And then you're leaving coldness here
It's getting darker now
The night is drawing closer my dear

[Pre-Chorus]
To writhe..
I found my suffering - the life
I hear you suffer me - to writhe
I bound my suffering - tonight

[Chorus]
The start of cold seasons
Just a road of despair
There is no way out of here
Again to feel you near

Why do you love to torture me
Cut me open and leave me this way?
And when away of de profundis
You disappear from me again

[Verse 3]
I can feel the warm nightfall
As I taste the death on her lips
I am doomed to hold this woe
It's time to kneel I'm so alone

[Pre-Chorus]
To writhe..
I found my suffering - the life
I hear you suffer me - to writhe
I bound my suffering - tonight

[Chorus]
The start of cold seasons
Just a road of despair
There is no way out of here
Again to feel you near

Why do you love to torture me
Cut me open and leave me this way?
And when away of de profundis
You disappear from me again

[Pre-Chorus]
To writhe..
I found my suffering - the life
I hear you suffer me - to writhe
I bound my suffering - tonight

[Verse 1]
Now I'm a grey old ghost
Weeping in winter trees
And searching for a soul
Waiting for a voice to come

[Verse 2]
She was worth dying for
It is my severed woes I cry
Her eyes were pale like dawn
Out of this gloomy light

[Chorus]
I'll wait there forevermore
The light holds us forever more
Still one second I wouldn't give away
Cold winter nights, I cry on your grave
Why won't you come?
Why won't you come?

[Verse 3]
As she is dying in the snow
The moonlight silently glows
Her tears flow down her cheek
When snow falls from the trees

[Chorus]
I'll wait there forevermore
The light holds us forever more
Still one second I wouldn't give away
Cold winter nights, I cry on your grave
Why won't you come?
Why won't you come?

[Verse 1]
The strength of her pulse is breaking her chest
She's getting wet from this feverish writhe
The midnight's cruel for a lonely girl
When the unknown slowly undresses her breasts

[Verse 2]
The voice - and her eyes wide shut
Her fever burns a mark on her bed
The path that she runs among these silent trees
Leads her body for me to claim

[Pre-Chorus]
The veil of fog covers her velvet skin
As she kneels naked under the moon

[Chorus]
The whispers from her lips
And her screams
Invite me to her ecstatic flame
Over and over again

[Verse 3]
Her bed is covered in dirt and leaves
And she's burning down on her knees
Midnight's cruel for a lonely girl
And she's getting wet from this feverish writhe

[Pre-Chorus]
The veil of fog covers her velvet skin
As she kneels naked under the moon

[Chorus]
The whispers from her lips
And her screams
Invite me to her ecstatic flame
Over and over again

[Pre-Chorus]
The veil of fog covers her velvet skin
As she kneels naked under the moon
The veil of fog covers her velvet skin
As she kneels naked under the moon

[Chorus]
The whispers from her lips
And her screams
Invite me to her ecstatic flame
Over and over again

[Verse 1]
Too late to leave, blinded by the last night
Too far, too late, too deep
To escape from the hands of this night
Winter has our hearts, it finally tore us apart

[Chorus]
The cries of loss, ripping wings
We are frozen on the lake
So close to watch her die
But too far to leave together
This tomb of ice finally ripped us apart

[Post-Chorus]
We are sleepless swans
Frozen on the lake

[Verse 2]
Lay down your eyes, blinded by the last night
The sun won't light them any longer
The deeper the dark, the clearer we see
Escaping death only made it stronger

[Chorus]
The cries of loss, ripping wings
We are frozen on the lake
So close to watch her die
But too far to leave together
This tomb of ice finally ripped us apart

[Post-Chorus]
We are sleepless swans
Frozen on the lake

[Interlude]
Waiting, silence, burning touch of air
Eyes, frozen, Orion, the map of sky is quiet
November sang us songs of goodbye
But foolish hearts hailed the wait

[Outro]
Winter has our hearts now
It finally tore us apart
We are sleepless swans
Frozen on the lake

[Verse 1]
And Heavens cried blood
As I swallowed the poison from her lips again
And Heavens cried blood
I felt no regrets for her death

[Verse 2]
No need for sympathies
What She got is what she deserved
She blackened the world
She blackened the sun

[Verse 3]
These drops of blood won't wash away your sins
I buried you deep to forget the pain
But every night I see you through sleep
Another cold night
Never-ending Hell

[Chorus]
Skies opened, red started to flow
Is it murder?
Sun shed its last rays
The seraphs fall
The angels are gone
The end will surely catch us all

[Verse 1]
And Heavens cried blood
As I swallowed the poison from her lips again
And Heavens cried blood
I felt no regrets for her death

[Verse 1]
And Heavens cried blood
As I swallowed the poison from her lips again
And Heavens cried blood
I felt no regrets for her death

[Chorus]
Skies opened, red started to flow
Is it murder?
Sun shed its last rays
The seraphs fall
The angels are gone
The end will surely catch us all

[Outro]
Sun shed its last rays
The end will surely catch us all

[Intro]
"I grasp the soil from the tomb
And cover my face
This face of a murderer"

[Verse 1]
Serpents betrayed me
They crawled in my head and betrayed me
Old woods, they misled me
Cut my face and misled me

The owls are not what they seem
They made me do it
Am I a ghost amongst them?
But this blood is real that stains my hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Tortured by these voices
Like flies around me
They chased me here
And you invited me in...

[Chorus]
These woods breathe evil!
Rust on the ground and the arches of fire!
These woods breathe evil!
Here in the circle of eerie winds!
Towards the black heart of magnetic north

[Verse 2]
Black lodge and red rooms of insanity
Here I reached the point of no return
With my hands around you
They chased me here

[Bridge]
To this hotel of ghosts
And they showed me this room
This room with a view
And you invited me in...

[Pre-Chorus]
Tortured by these voices
Like flies around me
They chased me here
And you invited me in...

[Chorus]
These woods breathe evil!
Rust on the ground and the arches of fire!
These woods breathe evil!
Here in the circle of eerie winds!

[Pre-Chorus]
Tortured by these voices
Like flies around me
They chased me here
And you invited me in...

[Chorus]
These woods breathe evil!
Rust on the ground and the arches of fire!
These woods breathe evil!
Here in the circle of eerie winds!

[Outro]
These woods...
They led me back here
To your buried body...

[Verse 1]
Memories start to fade
Only a gray thought of something
Was it even me?
All the scars remind me
I was somewhere
Somewhere

[Verse 2]
Forgotten you were
So don't dare to rise
Stay in your tomb
Whoever you were

[Pre-Chorus]
I washed myself with pain
A long time ago
So deep that nothing
Can reach me

[Chorus]
These deep shadows of my heart, crushing pain
It follows in voices, the rooms, the garden
Leaving me to bleed the truth of it all
Who ever is sentenced to love
Will bow down as a servant of sorrow

[Verse 3]
Searching memories of the days of light
It will kill me, even a touch of warmth
But I long for it more
Than the stone I've turned to

[Chorus]
These deep shadows of my heart, crushing pain
It follows in voices, the rooms, the garden
Leaving me to bleed the truth of it all
Who ever is sentenced to love
Will bow down as a servant of sorrow

[Bridge]
Alone in this castle, in these halls of gloom
An old shape, once a brave man
Now the servant of sorrow

I washed myself with pain
A long time ago
So deep that nothing
Can reach me

[Chorus]
These deep shadows of my heart, crushing pain
It follows in voices, the rooms, the garden
Leaving me to bleed the truth of it all
Who ever is sentenced to love
Will bow down as a servant of sorrow[Intro]
"I lost the last of my hope on that night
When the morning never came
Staring in the eye of all those ghosts of loss
And like the plague it crushed me
On the eve of a new moon"

[Verse 1]
I'm made of filth, of lies
No clean blood runs in me
I've turned to everything I hate
Black blood and dirt in a human shell

[Verse 2]
Leaving these trails of betrayal
Cold lifeless flesh, a so called man

[Verse 3]
Choking on the pain of others
In my own lies I drown
Happiness was all I reached for
But sure, no one deserves it
That dim light I still held, finally faded

[Verse 4]
There was so much in me that I trusted
But so little I knew
The weakness I held was stronger than anything
And it turned me into arrows for the ones I truly loved

[Outro]
Forgive me for falling
I know you all trusted in me
But I'm made of filth, of lies
No good blood runs in me

Forgive me all, no more hope[Intro]
"Tomorrow will be worse"
I heard her say
As she closed the curtains
And walked away

[Verse 1]
Tied on the bed by hands of the past
Memories too painful to be opened
My body crushed and burned from escaping life
The sleep will come, with horrors of you...

[Chorus]
New moon, would you open the gates
And take me away from this night
New moon, between the curtains
Walk me away on your silvery bridge
New moon, lay your mercy on me tonight

[Verse 2]
The despair of morning sun, beams of unholy light
No one can read the signs of these eyes
The prayer of escape, I will never heal

[Bridge]
The flames on my skin to wash all bad away
Was unpurifying kiss of suffering

[Pre-Chorus]
But I judge myself to give it all away, for you...

[Chorus]
New moon, would you open the gates
And take me away from this night
New moon, between the curtains
Walk me away on your silvery bridge
New moon, lay your mercy on me tonight

[Intro]
Father, why did you drown me here
In these waters?
And Father, why did you leave me here
In deep waters?

Father, it's getting darker here
As the years pass
And Father, I'm the whispers on the lake
Lights on water

[Verse 1]
My child, I carry the burden of sorrow with your soul
The songs you gently sing to me
But the love was never stronger
Than the grief of your unholy price

[Verse 2]
I curse you forever in your watery grave
You passenger of evil
For taking her away from me
The blood of your arrival
Cutting knives and shadows
A ceremony of pain

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Through living flesh to the dead
Both in my bloody hands, but only one cried

[Pre-Chorus 2]
In blazing fury I carried you through the woods
While the trees tried to stop me in horror
Your cry echoed on the lake
As I laid you down on the boat

[Chorus]
The tears made circles on the still water
The circles made the waves
The waves raised the tide and made rain fall
Raised the lights on the lake

The tears made circles on the still water
The circles made the waves
The waves raised the tide and made rain fall
Raised the lights on the lake

[Bridge]
Through the mist, further on the lake
In the eye of still water
Into the deepest pit you silently fell
Slowly in the throat of dark water

[Chorus]
The tears made circles on the still water
The circles made the waves
The waves raised the tide and made rain fall
Raised the lights on the lake

The tears made circles on the still water
The circles made the waves
The waves raised the tide and made rain fall
Raised the lights on the lake[Verse 1]
Hold me, this world is falling down on me
Feel it, is it the dead or death
That walks among us?

[Chorus]
Close your eyes but stay awake
They are trying to crawl inside your head
Wish I could end this all today
But like all good, our hope fades away

[Verse 2]
Hold me, few more steps and I will fall
Watch me, I'll take you with me
Too sad to leave alone

[Bridge]
Burden on my shoulders
The curse of man
No stepping back
I'll take you there
No life, no cries
No more sleepless nights

[Chorus]
Close your eyes but stay awake
They are trying to crawl inside your head
Wish I could end this all today
But like all good, our hope fades away

Close your eyes but stay awake
They are trying to crawl inside your head
Wish I could end this all today
But like all good, our hope fades away

[Verse 1]
Speak through the silence
Lay down your crown
Lay down your fight

[Chorus]
And when you speak
The words of silence
Walls will crumble in
And skies open
And when you speak
You speak with silence, and I
Carve each word you sing
On my stone wings
And the light will pour in

[Verse 2]
The fires are burning under starlight
Through veils of golden light
The sails so pure, so white
Through the river of death
I carry you, my love
Breathe in the night
My arms alight

[Chorus]
And when you speak
The words of silence
Walls will crumble in
And skies open
And when you speak
(And when you speak)
You speak with silence, and I
Carve each word you sing
On my stone wings
And the light will pour in now

[Bridge]
I threw this iron crown
Into the eye of inferno
This lake of fire, this pit of ghosts
Breathing in the dark
Exhaling the dust of stars
In this shrine of silver light
On the edge of the moon, you sing to me
The river flows so deep
Through my heart and through my eyes
As you turn into the light
The dust of silver stars

[Chorus]
And then you speak
(And then you speak)
The words of silence
Walls will crumble in
And skies open
And when you speak
(And when you speak)
You speak with silence, and I
Carve each word you sing
On my stone wings
And the light will pour in
Carve each word you sing
On my stone wings now

[Verse 1]
I'm drowning
In this black stream
Of sunken dreams
Under the water
I'm breathing in
I'm breathing
(The phantoms, the nightmares)

[Chorus]
And the firelights
Upon the waters burning
On the aisle of time
Where golden torches burning bright
Touch the raven eyes now
All tides of dark are turning
Trust in the night now
Inside the fires burning bright

[Verse 2]
I'm floating
Upon this black stream
Of broken dreams
Upon the water
I'm bleeding
I'm bleeding
(The phantoms, the nightmares)

[Chorus]
And the firelights
Upon the waters burning
On the aisle of time
Where golden torches burning bright
Touch the raven eyes now
All tides of dark are turning
Trust in the night now
Inside the fires burning bright

[Post-Chorus]
Pull me under
Under these black waves
Fill my lungs with your fire
Their poison ropes cut into my hands

[Bridge]
Drown me down to your abyss
Blind my eyes with your blades
I drag you with me into these flames
And all that remains
Are ashes
Of phantoms
Of fears

[Chorus]
And the firelights
Upon the waters burning
On the aisle of time
Where golden torches burning bright
Touch the raven eyes now
All tides of dark are turning
Trust in the night now
Inside the fires burning bright[Intro]
Don't catch me at the wrong time
Or you will feel my wrath
The one I wished I never had (wished I never had)

[Hook]
I need to rid myself of resentment
And every last bit of it
If I'm going to live up to the things I've written
I need to clear my mind of this anger
And all the rage that I've held near
If I'm going to live up to the words I've spoken

[Verse 1]
But I haven't yet
Letting go
Is how I can start to fight my way
Out of this hole I've dug
In this war against myself (this war against myself)
But I haven't yet (but I haven't yet)

[Bridge]
Don't catch me at the wrong time or you will feel my wrath
The one I wished I never had (wished I never had)
I wish I never had this demon inside
I wish I knew how to cast it out
I wish I never had this demon inside
I wish I knew how to cast it out
But I fear it will never leave me (but I fear it will never leave me)

[Hook]
I need to rid myself of resentment
And every last bit of it
If I'm going to live up to the things I've written
I need to clear my mind of this anger
And all the rage that I've held near
If I'm going to live up to the words I've spoken

[Bridge 2]
Letting go, Just let it go
I know, I know
Letting go, Just let it go
I know, I know
Letting go, Just let it go
I know, I know
Letting go, Just let it go
I know, I know

[Verse 2]
I know I need to let go
Of everything that has
Ever made me think myself better
I'm not better than anyone else
Of anything that's filled me with anger
That I have taken out on everyone else (on everyone else)
These demons will never leave me
I can only find ways to not let them out
These demons will never leave me
But I control them, not the other way around...

[Intro]

[Chorus]
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?

Whoa-oh-ohh

[Verse 1]
With just a look, they shook
And heavens bowed before him
Simply a look can break your heart
The stars that pierce the sky
He left them all behind
We’re left to wonder why
He left us all behind

[Chorus]
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?

[Verse 2]
Dreams of his crash won’t pass
Oh, how they all adored him
Beauty will last when spiraled down
The stars that mystify
He left them all behind
And how his children cried
He left us all behind

[Chorus]
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?

[Bridge]
What's the hook, the twist
Within this verbose mystery?
I would gladly bet my life upon it
That the ghost you love, your ray of light
Will fizzle out without hope
We're the empty set just floating through, wrapped in skin
Ever searching for what we were promised
Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

[Chorus]
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?

[Video][Verse 1]
Disappear, without a trace
A treasure lost, I can't replace
The only piece that still remains
Is in these scars, is in this pain

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to save it all
I want to take it all
My heart is holding on
I bleed, I bleed for love

[Chorus]
When I'm gone
When I fade away
Is the air I breathe my only legacy?
When I'm gone

[Verse 2]
In the dark, I am a flame
A passing light, all in vain
I feel the pull, I feel a change
It's over now, it slips away

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to save it all
I want to take it all
My heart is holding on
I bleed, I bleed for love

[Chorus]
When I'm gone
When I fade away
Is the air I breathe my only legacy?
When I'm gone

[Refrain]
When I'm gone
When I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to save it all
I want to take it all
My heart is holding on
I bleed, I bleed for love

[Chorus]
When I'm gone
When I fade away
Is the air I breathe my only legacy?
When I'm gone

[Outro]
When I'm gone

[Verse 1]
I'll smile, I know what it takes to fool this town
I'll do it 'til the sun goes down and all through the night time
Oh yeah, I'll tell you what you wanna hear
I'll turn my head and shed a tear
It's never the right time, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll put my armor on
Show you how strong I am
I'll put my armor on
I'll show you that I am

[Chorus]
I'm unstoppable
I'm running with no brakes
I'm invincible
Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident, yeah, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
I'm unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today

[Verse 2]
Break down, only alone I will cry out now
You’ll never see what’s hiding out
Hiding out deep down (yeah)
I know, I’ve heard that to let your feelings show
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But I’m too afraid now (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll put my armor on
Show you how strong I am
I'll put my armor on
I'll show you that I am

[Chorus]
I'm unstoppable
I'm running with no brakes
I'm invincible
Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident, yeah, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
I'm unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
I'm unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll put my armor on
Show you how strong I am
I'll put my armor on
I'll show you that I am

[Chorus]
I'm unstoppable
I'm running with no brakes
I'm invincible
Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident, yeah, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
I'm unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
I'm unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today

[Verse 1]
Burning
I step into the sun
And it stings me
The traces of your love
What have I become

[Chorus]
Lost inside a memory
Buried deep inside of me
Never breaking
I'm escaping
Lost inside a memory
Can't erase the agony
Never breaking
Overtaking now

[Verse 2]
Learning
The meaning of life
And it haunts me
What you're running through my mind
Left my heart so blind

[Chorus]
Lost inside a memory
Buried deep inside of me
Never breaking
I'm escaping
Lost inside a memory
Can't erase the agony
Never breaking
Overtaking

[Bridge]
Now
You're overtaking me

[Chorus]
Lost inside a memory
Buried deep inside of me
Never breaking
I'm escaping
Lost inside a memory
Can't erase the agony
Never breaking

[Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Verse 2]
So close no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters[Verse 1]
The light at the end has faded away
One terror after another
Somewhere in the fire
The embers of faith
Will burn through tomorrow
You're breathing

[Chorus]
It's worth the pain
God's in the rain
It's not too late to start again
It's worth the pain
So hold on tonight

[Verse 2]
Your passionate eyes try to explain
All the blindness you're feeling
The six feet of lies exposed in His fire
Resurrecting your sunrise
You're breathing

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
There's grace
When you're at your wit's end
Begging for it
He'll take you by the hand
There's grace

[Verse 1]
Dear pain, oh, it's been a long time
Remember when you were holding me tight
I would stay awake with you all night

Dear shame, I was safe in your arms
You were there when it all fell apart
I would get so lost in your beautiful lies

[Pre-Chorus]
I let you go but you're still chasing

[Chorus]
Go ahead, you're never going to take me
You can bend, but you're never going to break me
I was yours, I'm not yours anymore
You don't own me

[Verse 2]
Dear hate, I know you're not far
You would wait at the door of my heart
I was amazed at the passion in your cries

Dear anger, you made me so high
You were faithful to show up on time
Such a flame that was burning in your eyes


[Chorus 2]
Go ahead, put a target on my forehead
You can fire, but you've got no bullet
I was yours, I'm not yours anymore
You don't own me

[Bridge]
You tempted me to look back
But everything that we had together was a lie

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]
All alone, in a place I can't remember
Lost control, forgot what I was chasing after
The lies I've tried to justify, have kept me up at night
I'm done trying to hide my life away from mercy's eyes

Every little secret, that I kept in Locked inside my heart
Every single regret, every misstep, that kept me in the dark
But now I stand face to face with the light of Your grace
And the weight of all my shame begins to fall
Once and for all
Once and for all

This is a war, I'm done with giving over
The weight is more, then I was ever meant to shoulder
Only You can save this life so I'll come clean tonight

Every little secret, that I kept in Locked inside my heart
Every single regret, every misstep, that kept me in the dark
But now I stand face to face with the light of Your grace
And the weight of all my shame begins to fall
Once and for all


You made right what I made wrong
Once and for all
You put an end to who I was
Once and for all
All the shame that's in my soul, met Your grace and its no more

Every little secret, that I kept in Locked inside my heart
Every single regret, every misstep, that kept me in the dark
But now I stand face to face with the light of Your grace
And the weight of all my shame begins to fall
Once and for all
Once and for all
Once and for all
Once and for all

[Verse 1]
On a road to nowhere
Tried to find myself there
I went as far as I could go
From everything I know

Now I'm emptied up and used
Broken and abused
But I still hear You

[Chorus]
Every time I run away
I hear Your voice inside of me
It's deafening
Can't fight it, can't fight it

Calling me to come back home
To the only place where I belong
It's deafening
Can't fight it, can't fight it

[Verse 2]
I can still hear you say
You will never escape
How far my love can reach
And I need you to believe

Now there's nothing left to lose
And hope is breaking through
And I still hear You

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You're never too far away
And it's never too late (x2)

[Verse 1]
It’s coming undone
This world that I made
I feel it descending now
The place that I run
Or what I run from
The boundary begins to fade

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every word’s a trap to your lies
Every life you try to save dies
You hold the truth like a knife
You couldn’t leave it behind

You’re my impostor
I’m a shadow lost deep inside

[Verse 2]
Now how does it feel
As you crawl away
The damage you left for me
I drink from your gaze
A new masquerade
I feel your disease growing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You need a villain to save
You left me here in my grave
You came and took it away
This innocence that I cannot replace

[Chorus]
Tell me that you were never real
You need another soul to steal
You’re my impostor
You tell me you were never really real

[Bridge]
Impostor, my impostor
Impostor, impostor

[Verse 1]
Take it away, I never thought I’d let it grow
This cancer inside, the villain plays the victim so well
Make me believe, I drink the lies, this suicide
Just put me to sleep, fall over me

[Pre-Chorus]
Lies, lies, lies
I taste the
Lies, lies, lies

[Chorus]
Fight, while I’m alive
I see you now
No less than light
Break, you’re falling away
Gravity lies
I feel it die
Gravity dies

[Verse 2]
Buried alive, an innocence cannot withstand this
Language of lies, to poison all the words you swallow
Wait for the scream, you realize it’s all a lie
And still you betray, I’ll throw you away

[Pre-Chorus]
Lies, lies, lies
I drink the
Lies, lies, lies

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Fight, while I’m alive
I see you now
No less than light
Break, you’re falling away
Gravity lies
I feel it die
Gravity dies
I feel you now
Gravity lies
I feel it die
Your gravity dies

[Verse 1]
It all looks different now
But it was right in front of me
The memories fall around
Of everything I used to be
Can I let it go
When I still feel your echoes
I watched you disappear
But I can’t make myself believe

[Chorus]
I gave it all
But you were fading
Where’d you go, all alone?
I couldn’t stay
Another fall, through the dark
Of the shadows
I reached for you, only you
There’s still a part
A part that’s holding on

[Verse 2]
Can we call it fair?
Or was it just a dire game?
Who’s the winner now
When I can’t even speak your name?
Caught inside the dream
When you were reaching back for me
Did you get lost inside?
Or did you disappear?

[Bridge]
Never tried to see
What it’s like to be
The one who lost it all
Did you find your way?
Is there still a place?
Is there a part of you
That’s holding on?
Still holding on?

I gave it all
But you were fading
Where’d you go, where’d you go?

[Chorus]I'm waiting for the rain now
To settle the dusty air
Clearing up my emotions
Facing it all if I dare
I've been thinking
I've been trying
But I've always been denying
Wasted days are still inside of me
It's time to set them free
Why don't we see what is going on?
There are not so many years to be wasted
Until the damage is done and the beauty is gone
Save Our Souls
What is the price that we pay?
Save Our Souls
Do we have nothing to say? All my life they let me know
How far I would not go
But inside the beast still grows
Waiting
Chewing through the ropes

Who are you to change this world?
Silly Boy!
No one needs to hear your words
Let it go

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Won't you come digest me?
Take away everything I am
Bring it to an end
Carnivore! Carnivore!
Could you come and change me?
Take away everything I am
Everything I am!

I will hide myself below
I'll be what you wanted
Kept inside I won't let go
'Till I burn beyond control

Who are you to change this world?
Silly Boy!
No one needs to hear your words
Let it go

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Won't you come digest me?
Take away everything I am
Bring it to an end
Make me fall. Make me bleed
Go ahead and change me!
Take away everything I am
Everything I am!

Never enough
(Who I am is not good enough)
Never enough
(Who I am)

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Won't you come digest me?
Take away everything I am
Bring it to an end
Carnivore! Carnivore!
Could you come and change me?
Take away everything I am
Everything I am![Verse 1]
Even a well lit place, can hide salvation
A map to a one man maze that never sees the sun
Where the lost are the heroes
And the thieves are left to drown
But everyone knows by now
Fairy-tales are not found
They are written in the walls

[Chorus]
As we walk in a straight line
Down in the dirt with a landslide approaching
But nothing could ever stop us
From stealing our own place in the sun
We will face the odds against us
And run into the fear we run from (ah, ah)
It has begun

[Verse 2]
Into the dark below
Evading shadows
Blind in a rabbit's hole
We fall beneath the earth
And watch the shell come unraveled
As the seed begins to rise
Embracing a starlit fate as we wait in the night
It's written in the walls

[Chorus]
As we walk in a straight line
Down in the dirt with a landslide approaching
But nothing could ever stop us
From stealing our own place in the sun
We will face the odds against us
And run into the fear we run from (ah, ah)

[Outro]
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)[Verse 1]
I cut you into pieces
Searching for your imperfections
I had plans to make you whole
But all my threads couldn't stop the bleeding
There's nothing left, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

[Chorus]
I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way, then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

[Verse 2]
Your eyes stare right through me
Ignoring my failed attempts to
Breathe back life into your veins
But I can't start your cold heart beating
You're so far gone, but I'm not leaving
When all I know is you

[Chorus]
I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way, then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

[Bridge]
And you left me more dead
Than you'll ever know
When you left me alone

[Chorus]
I've been looking for a way
To bring you back to life
And if I could find a way, then I would bring you back tonight
I'd make you look, I'd make you lie
I'd take the coldness from your eyes
But you told me, if you love me
Let it die

[Outro]
Let it die
Let it die
Let it die
Let it die

[Verse 1]
In the cold at winters fall, they plan captivates us all
They would work us 'til our bones where broken and our souls followed
I met man who saved my life, to this day I don't know why
He would smuggle kids in front of me that would buy my life some time

[Bridge]
Walking, there where thousands of us, nothing like I've seen before
With the ice beneath us, our feet where frozen and our clothes where torn
But it will be a cold day in hell before I fall

[Verse 2]
In the dark and sunken eyes, in which humanity had died
All the feelings and emotions in them have been cauterized
You gave me something to believe when the end was in sight
As I drifted into the darkness you provided me with light

[Bridge]
Walking, there where thousands of us, nothing like I've seen before
With the ice beneath us, our feet where frozen and our clothes where torn
It was a sea of dead shadows

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll let the Heavens take me, and save me from this life
Or is that giving up too easy? I cannot let them win the fight
Another life is awaiting me, I see the finish line
Nothing can stop me from living, the death march claims me no more

[Verse 3]
They're turning ordinary people, into lifeless ghostly shadows
No one knows why we're there to stop them, the death march takes us all
Steer like a dream, all the plans far from here
All the things I've seen, never live in fear

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll let the Heavens take me, and save me from this life
Or is that giving up too easy? I cannot let them win the fight
Another life is awaiting me, I see the finish line
Nothing can stop me from living, the death march claims me no more
No more

[Verse 1]
Is it just me or am I thinking too freely?
There is something running through my head that shouldn't be
I cannot speak aloud what I'm really feeling
I close my eyes, try to believe these stories

[Bridge]
Deep down there's something telling me
A false sense of security

[Verse 2]
As we adhere to all these things that you're preaching
Are you so sure of all these things that you're teaching?
Uncertainty won't ever stand up against it
But all it seems to cause is war and hatred

[Bridge]
You're all too ignorant to see
Its all for power and for greed
You are the puppets on the strings

[Chorus]
It's time to wake up from these force fed lies
No chance for choices when they shield your eyes
Don't let me be the only one who sees
'Cause I'm the eye among the blind

[Verse 3]
When people sacrifice their loved ones for honor
There is no honorable in cold blooded murder
Relentless chaos and destruction in God's hands
Can't help but to think:
Is this really his plan

[Bridge]
Deep down there's something telling me
A false sense of security
You're all too ignorant to see
Its all for power and for greed
You are the puppets on the strings

[Chorus]
It's time to wake up from these force fed lies
No chance for choices when they shield your eyes
Don't let me be the only one who sees
'Cause I'm the eye among the blind

[Verse 4]
How will I ever win this fight? So many on the other side
They're controlling all your minds, and no one hears me cry
Think of children born and left, all hopes and dreams perished
The effects of all civilization, blinded
Put your trust in all divine, blame it on your brothers
Never knowing if I'm alright, praying for the answers
When it comes down to your life, where to point the finger
You're all pointing to the sky, blaming your creator

[Chorus]
It's time to wake up from these force fed lies
No chance for choices when they shield your eyes
Don't let me be the only one who sees
'Cause I'm the eye among the blind
It's time to wake up from these force fed lies
No chance for choices when they shield your eyes
Don't let me be the only one who sees
'Cause I'm the eye among the blind

[Verse 1]
A voice screaming from within
Begging just to feel again
Can't find who I am without you near me
I'd give anything to live
Without you I don't exist
Your the only one who saves me from myself

[Pre-Chorus]
I abandoned this love and laid it to rest
And now I'm one of the forgotten

[Chorus]
I'm not, I'm not myself
Feel like I'm someone else
Fallen and faceless
So hollow, hollow inside
A part of me is dead
Need you to live again
Can you replace this
I'm hollow, hollow and faceless

[Verse 2]
Shadows growing in my mind
Ones I just can't leave behind
I'm not strong enough to pay this ransom
One more monster crawled inside
But I swear I saw it die
Can you save me from the nothing I've become

[Pre-Chorus]
I abandoned this love and laid it to rest
And now I'm one of the forgotten

[Chorus]
I'm not, I'm not myself
Feel like I'm someone else
Fallen and faceless
So hollow, hollow inside
A part of me is dead
Need you to live again
Can you replace this
I'm hollow, hollow and faceless

[Transition]
So faceless
I'm hollow and faceless

[Bridge]
We are the faceless
We are the nameless
We are the hopeless
Until we have faces

[Chorus]
I'm not, I'm not myself
Feel like I'm someone else
Fallen and faceless
So hollow, hollow inside
A part of me is dead
Need you to live again
Can you replace this
I'm hollow, hollow and faceless

[Verse 1]
Enemy, familiar friend
My beginning and my end
Knowing truth, whispering lies
And it hurts again

[Verse 2]
What I fear, and what I try
The words I say and what I hide
All the pain I want it to end
But I want it again

[Chorus]
And it finds me
The fight inside is coursing through my veins
And it's raging
The fight inside is breaking me again

[Verse 3]
Still the same, pursuing pain
Is it worth all I have gained?
We both know how this will end
But I do it again

[Chorus]
And it finds me
The fight inside is coursing through my veins
And it's raging
The fight inside is hurting me again

[Post-Chorus]
And it finds me
The war within me pulls me under
And without you
The fight inside is breaking me again

[Bridge]
It's nothing (It's everything)
It's nothing (It's everything)
It's nothing (It's everything)
It's nothing, it's everything

[Chorus]
And it finds me
The fight inside is coursing through my veins
And it's raging
The fight inside is hurting me again

[Post-Chorus]
And it finds me
The war within me pulls me under
And without you
The fight inside is breaking me again

[Outro]
It's breaking me, it's breaking me
I'm falling apart, I'm falling apart

[Verse 1]
A heart made of stone
Callous and bone
Fracture and tear it out
To let it go
And to think
I called it my own
And I would have never thought
The pain could grow

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll break it
Knowing what you said
The pain is what you make it
Sadly you are so mistaken
I will take it with a grain
And step into the changes
Throw away the empty heart

[Chorus]
Right now
Never want to leave this place and
Right now
See it in a different way so
Right now
Even if you take me home
I'll stand, the lonely
Stand, the lonely

[Verse 2]
It's harder to know
Just where to go
If only the stars aligned
The sunsets glowed
I don't need
A calm in the storm
Or something to scream about
With empty lungs

[Verse 1]
A boy of anguish, now he's a man of soul
Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the road
The years were cruel to him, no he won't let them go
Lays awake tryina find the man inside to pack his bags and escape this world

[Chorus]
I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on

[Verse 2]
He wanted to change the world, to make it all worthwhile
So he put his pen to paper and poured out everything inside
His red eyes tearing up at the man that he'd became
Slowly but surely on the fast track to falling into his grave

[Chorus]
I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on

[Bridge]
I can't believe I've come so far in such short time
And I'm still fighting on my own
If I stop to catch my breath I might never breathe again
So just know this
I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I can't believe I let myself break down

[Chorus]
I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on
I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't want to do this anymore, I'm moving on

[Outro]
A boy of anguish, now he's a man of soul
Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the roadI guess you don't believe me now
You never wanted this
Back turned and the wind is all you have
It's all you needed

You're all right, you're all right now
(You believe what you want to)
Gone somehow, you've gone somehow
But I'm waiting for you

Get back to where you once believed
Get back, get back
You want so bad to bury me
Get back, get back

A far cry from a picture perfect calm
Or can you see it?
A bright light from a distance leaves you dark
You're never free here

You're all right, you're all right now
(You believe what you want to)
Gone somehow, you've gone somehow
But I'm waiting for you

Get back to where you once believed
Get back, get back
You want so bad to bury me
Get back, get back

You never noticed what I had in mind (had in mind)
I made a way but you have run so far now
Whatever thing that you just had to find (had to find)
You'll never see it but it kills you slowly
Yeah, it's gonna kill you slowly
Yeah, it's gonna kill you slowly

Get back to where you once believed
Get back, get back
You want so bad to bury me
Get back, get back

Get back to where you once believed
Get back, get back
You want so bad to bury me
Get back, get back[Verse 1]
Reckless and weary
The truth has been buried
Held down by the hand
That refuses to carry
The burden you built
The lies, do you hear me?
The insult, the white flag
You refuse to carry
I'm letting you go
And all that you showed me
I'm letting you know
That you don't control me
The feeling is cold
And life is unfolding
Reckless and weary
I'm desperately holding on

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you can't get a word in
It's because I don't care what you think
Don't be alone inside
A world that's filled with make-believe

[Chorus]
Broke inside
This life, you can never be reborn within
I came this far erase my scars
Fight this time
Inside, take a break from the lie you live
I came this far erase my scars

[Verse 2]
Find my control
Find reasons to beat this
Find truth below
The lies and the wreckage
I can't let go
I'm too close, too restless
I'm letting you know
I'm far too aggressive

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you can't get a word in
It's because I don't care what you think
Don't be alone inside
A world that's filled with make-believe

[Chorus]
Broke inside
This life, you can never be reborn within
I came this far erase my scars
Fight this time
Inside, take a break from the lie you live
I came this far erase my scars

[Hook]
Erase my scars

[Verse 3]
Five years ago
My life was affected
By years of hope and learning life lessons
You let me know
By leaving me helpless
What then was unknown is now unprotected
I'm so

[Chorus]
Broke inside
This life, you can never be reborn within
I came this far erase my scars
Fight this time
Inside, take a break from the lie you live
I came this far erase my scars

[Outro]
Erase my scars
Broke inside
Broke inside
Broke inside

[Verse 1]
You track the doubts of my soul
Until you found it
The darkened room locked away
I let you in

[Verse 2]
You looked inside then you turned away
My makeshift savior
He left me right here in my chains
But still I whisper
Still I call you

[Chorus]
I never wanted you to see
The darkest part of me
I knew you’d run away
I waited but you never came
So afraid to be alone
I tried to let you go
And still I find you lost inside the darkest part of me

[Verse 3]
It’s my descent
To know your pain
It’s watching all
I believed fade away

[Verse 4]
Of traitors and fools
Of beggars and thieves
Which mask will you choose
What is underneath

[Chorus]
I never wanted you to see
The darkest part of me
I knew you’d run away
I waited but you never came
So afraid to be alone
I tried to let you go
And still I find you lost inside the darkest part of me

[Bridge]
I'm the black stain of your perfect life
And I'm the darkness that you need to hide
It covers you
It spills over you

[Chorus]
I never wanted you to see
The darkest part of me
I knew you’d run away
I waited but you never came
So afraid to be alone
I tried to let you go
And still I find you lost inside the darkest part of me

[Verse 1]
I can see you running, running
Running, running
Every night from the same darkness
It's coming, coming
Coming, coming
But you are not alone
If you just say the word
I'll be there by your side
You make me more
You make me superhuman
And if you need me to
I will save you

[Chorus]
Send out the signal and I'll fly low
If it means the death of me, I won't let go
And if I'm lost in the worlds shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo

[Verse 2]
When you're backed against the wall
I could be the one who's always there to break your fall
You are not alone
You're the sun, you're the day
The light that guides me through
Never run, run away
I will save you

[Chorus]
Send out the signal and I'll fly low
If it means the death of me, I won't let go
And if I'm lost in the worlds shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo

Send out the signal and I'll fly low
If it means the death of me, I won't let go
And if I'm lost in the worlds shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo

And if I'm lost in the worlds shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo
From your halo
From your halo
I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go

And if I'm lost in the worlds shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo
Halo...
Your halo

[Chorus]
Hey-o

When we get started man, we ain't gonna stop

[Verse 1]
I am not afraid
Of the storm that comes my way
When it hits, it shakes me to the core
And makes me stronger than before
It's not a question about trust
But will you stand with us
Can you feel it
Make it real and

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it might wash away tonight
Awakened from this never ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting is not just writing

[Chorus]
Hey-o

[Verse 2]
There's a rumble in the floor
So get prepared for war
When it hits it'll knock you to the ground
When it shakes up everything around
But survival is a must
So will you stand with us
Can you feel it
Make it real and make me feel it

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it might wash away tonight
Awakened from this never ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting is not just writing

[Chorus]
Hey-o

Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more
Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is ya last warning, a courtesy call

[Verse 1]
It's a truth that in love and war
Worlds collide and hearts get broken
I want to live like I know I'm dying
Take up my cross, not be afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop steppin'
Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend your locket
I'm tired of all these rockers sayin' come with me

[Chorus]
Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change

[Verse 2]
It creeps in like a thief in the night
Without a sign, without a warning
But we are ready and prepared to fight
Raise up your swords, don't be afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop steppin'
Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend ya locket
I'm tired of all these rockers sayin' come with me

[Chorus]
Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change

[Bridge]
This is a warning, like it or not
I break down, like a record spinning
Gotta get up
So back off
This is a warning, like it or not
I'm tired of listenin', I'm warning you, don't try to get up

There's a war going on inside of me tonight (don't be afraid)
There's a war going on inside of me tonight (don't be afraid)

[Chorus]
Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change
It's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change

[Verse 1]
A heart made of stone
Callous and bone
Fracture and tear it out
To let it go
And to think
I called it my own
And I would have never thought
The pain could grow

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll break it
Knowing what you said
The pain is what you make it
Sadly you are so mistaken
I will take it with a grain
And step into the changes
Throw away the empty heart

[Chorus]
Right now
Never want to leave this place and
Right now
See it in a different way so
Right now
Even if you take me home
I'll stand, the lonely
Stand, the lonely

[Verse 2]
It's harder to know
Just where to go
If only the stars aligned
The sunsets glowed
I don't need
A calm in the storm
Or something to scream about
With empty lungs

[Verse 1]
You know you need a fix when you fall down
You know you need to find a way
To get you through another day
Let me be the one to numb you out
Let me be the one to hold you,
Never gonna let you get away
The shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on

[Chorus]
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You love me till it's all over, over
Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on, the dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

[Verse 2]
I know what you want so desperately
You know I'll give you one for free
Forever you're coming back to me
Now I'm gonna give you what you need
Cause I know what you feed on
And what you lean on
And what you lean on
The shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on

[Chorus]
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You love me till it's all over, over
Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on, the dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

[Bridge]
Did you find another cure?
Did you find another cure?

[Chorus]
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You love me till it's all over, over
Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on, the dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

[Verse 1]
I will run alone tonight
Without you by my side
I guess you had a place you had to get to
I know your eyes
I know inside
The walls you hide behind
And I saw the truth inside the real you

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I know you're lost when you run away
Into the same black holes and black mistakes
Taking all my will just to run alone
When are you coming home?

[Chorus]
Even if the sky does fall
Even if they take it all
There's no pain that I won't go through
Even if I have to die for you
And when all the fires burn
When everything is overturning
There's no thing that I won’t go through
Even if I have to die for you

[Verse 2]
One day the Earth will open wide
And I’ll follow you inside
'Cause the only hell I know is without you
Some day when galaxies collide
We'll be lost on different skies
I will send my rocket ship to find you

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I know you're lost when you run away
Into the same black holes and black mistakes
Taking all my will just to run alone
Until I bring you home

[Chorus]
Even if the sky does fall
Even if they take it all
There's no pain that I won't go through
Even if I have to die for you
And when all the fires burn
When everything is overturning
There's no thing that I won’t go through
Even if I have to die for you

[Bridge]
And if the sun grows cold for you along the way
And if the stars don’t line to light the way
And when you fall away and crash back down below
I’ll search the skies for you and I’ll follow
In your afterglow
And I’ll bring you home

[Chorus]
Even if the sky does fall
Even if they take it all
I can't see but I'll follow you
Even if I'd die
And when all the fires burn
When everything is overturning
There's no thing that I won’t go through
Even if I have to die for you

[Intro]
Your skin is thin
Your skin is thin

[Verse 1]
The sky is falling on you
I know what you're after
My eyes, so cold and abused
I know what you're after

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the pain wake up inside
I take the blame so I can hide
All the scars
You stay the same so long I've tried
To break the chains now I can find
All your scars

[Chorus]
Get me out of here
So I can breathe
It's all become so clear
What lies beneath
Your skin (your skin) it's thin (it's thin)
Your never gonna keep me down
Get me out, just get me out of here

[Verse 1]
I've tried for so long, for you
I know what you're after
Your lies, still unknown (unknown)
The truth (the truth)
I know what you're after

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the pain wake up inside
I take the blame so I can hide
All the scars
You stay the same so long I've tried
To break the chains now I can find
All your scars

[Chorus]
Get me out of here
So I can breathe
It's all become so clear
What lies beneath
Your skin (your skin) it's thin (it's thin)
Your never gonna keep me down
Get me out, just get me out of here
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 3]
Life can not go on this way
You're a walking tragedy
Stuck in here I need to lay
Stuck in here I'm breaking free
Breaking free (scream)

[Chorus]
Get me out of here
So I can breathe
It's all become so clear
What lies beneath
Your skin (your skin) it's thin (it's thin)
You're never gonna keep me down
Get me out, just get me out of here

[Outro]
I feel the pain wake up inside
I take the blame so I can hide
All the scars
You stay the same so long I've tried
To break the chains now I can find
All your scars

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Tired eyes, barely open
Crippled by a promise broken
I have seen an empire falling
Hopeless, can you hear me calling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn away from all that I know
Burning this bridge behind me
Light the way and I'll follow
Where you go

[Chorus]
Can you tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here again
I'm down with the fallen again

[Verse 2]
Searching through the darkness below
For a light in seas of shadows
Far from you, but I could never
Abdicate, I'll fight forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn away from all that I know
Burning this bridge behind me
Light the way and I'll follow
Where you go

[Chorus]
Can you tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here again
I'm down with the fallen again

[Bridge]
I will not run
I will not fall
I will not bury it
This is war!
War!
This is war!
War!

[Chorus 2]
Tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here (again)
Tell me what is real?
Cause I've lost my way again
Can you tell me how to feel?
Cause I don't feel anything
Now that I'm down here (again)
I'm down with the fallen again

[Outro]
Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooh
There’s a fire burning inside me
Cold steel calls out my name
Tempted to give in to the rage
Torn apart by this affliction
Locked up inside myself
This life is much too young to fade

I ran away from the pain
Always breaking down inside
Incomplete
But now I see
This won’t be the end of me

The world around me
Sells an empty promise
They build you up just to watch you fall
It’s time to meet this face to face

I ran away from the pain
Always breaking down inside
Incomplete
But now I see
This won’t be the end of me

Black and white melt into grey
Till every truth is stripped away
When nothing’s wrong nothing’s okay
Everyone has been betrayed

I ran away from the pain
Always breaking down inside
Incomplete
But now I see
This won’t be the end of me

[Verse 1]
Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet
Every roommate kept awake
By every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still don't miss you yet
Only when I stop to think about it

[Chorus]
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

[Verse 2]
Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet
Only when I stop to think about it

[Chorus]
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

[Bridge]
Only when I stop to think about you, I know
Only when you stop to think about me, do you know?

[Outro]
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
You hate everything about me
Why do you love me?
I hate, you hate
I hate, you love me
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?[Verse 1]
Are you deaf, can you hear me?
'Cause I'm sick of it all
Always digging in my skin
Always pushing my back to the wall

In my eyes there's a madness
Can't believe what I saw
And I'll be here laughing
When you fall

[Chorus]
And there's nothing to say
'Cause I'm already gone
You know I'm not like you
You were never wrong

Go ahead walk away
But I want you to know
I always hated you
Hated you from hello
Hated you from hello

[Verse 2]
Listen up, can you feel this?
'Cause the curtain has called
I will never regret it
And I'll be here watching it all

This is not what I wanted
But I think you'll recall
That I promised I'd be here
When you crawl

[Chorus]
And there's nothing to say
'Cause I'm already gone
You know I'm not like you
You were never wrong

Go ahead walk away
But I want you to know
I always hated you
Hated you from hello
Hated you from hello

[Bridge]
And I can feel the anger in me start to grow
(All the hate that's inside me)
(Overtaking me)
And everything about you is fake and hollow
(All the things that they can't see)
(Are the things I see)
And no one's gonna stop you when you go

[Chorus]
And there's nothing to say
'Cause I'm already gone
You know I'm not like you
You were never wrong
Go ahead walk away
But I want you to know
I always hated you
Hated you from hello
Hated you from hello
Hated you from hello[Intro]
In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life?

[Verse 1]
In the end
As my soul's laid to rest
What is left of my body
Or am I just a shell?
And I have fought
And with flesh and blood I commanded an army
Through it all
I have given my heart for a moment of glory
(I gave it all)

[Chorus]
In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life (oh whoa oh oh)
And who will remember your last goodbye (oh whoa oh oh)
Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to die

[Verse 2]
Born a saint
Though with every sin I still wanna be holy
I will live again
Who we are
Isn't how we live we are more than our bodies
If I fall I will rise back up and relive my glory

[Chorus]
In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life (oh whoa oh oh)
And who will remember your last goodbye (oh whoa oh oh)
Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die

[Chorus]
In the end
As we fade into the night (oh whoa oh oh)
Who will tell the story of your life (oh whoa oh oh)
And who will remember your last goodbye (oh whoa oh oh)
Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die

Who will remember this last goodbye (oh whoa oh oh)
Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die

Not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
Not not afraid
I'm not afraid to die!

[Verse 1]
It's gonna get harder from here
We've gotta get smarter to make it out alive
'cause you say stop and we say go
Don't wanna be your tenth caller on the radio
So don't bother cutting me off short tonight
We let our words speak for themselves
Don't take it all so far
Don't make it that much harder
Than it already is for you to stand alone
For you [x3]

[Chorus]
To wake up knowing you've got the day
To take on without feeling okay
To make yourself unwilling to sleep away
(Sleep away the pain)
Don't take off running without my say
Don't pay that price you thought you'd pay
You've got the choice, you've got the time of day
Just don't sleep away the pain

[Verse 2]
Hold on tight to the things you're given
The camera caught it all
Aren't we all forgiven now?
'cause you say stop and we say go
The world outside is calling on the telephone
They need answers so we'll let them know tonight
We let our words speak for themselves
But maybe I'm not right
We're so damaged by the sunlight
Can we make it through together
'cause honey, I don't like this kind of weather
When I'm with you

[Bridge]
It's gonna get harder from here
We've gotta get smarter
To get this all in line
'cause you say stop and we say go, oh

[Chorus]
Just don't sleep away the pain

[Verse 1]
I’m just the boy inside the man
Not exactly who you think I am
Trying to trace my steps back here again so many times
I’m just a speck inside your hand
You came and made me who I am
I remember where it all began so clearly

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a million miles away
Still you connect me in your way
And you create in me
Something I would’ve never seen
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
I hope that they see you in me
After all the lights go down
I’m just the words you are the sound
A strange type of chemistry
How you’ve become a part of me
And when I sit alone at night
Your thoughts burn through me like a fire
You’re the only one who knows who I really am

[Chorus]
We all wanna be somebody
We just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody
We’re willing to go but not that far

[Verse 2]
And we’re all see through, just like glass
And we can shatter just as fast
That light’s been burned out for a while
I still see it every time I pass
It was lost in the corners of my mind
Behind a box of reasons why
I never doubted it was there
It just took a little time to find and even when

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a million miles away
Still you connect me in your way
And you create in me something
I would’ve never seen
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
I hope that they see you in me
After all the lights go down
I’m just the words you are the sound
A strange type of chemistry
How you’ve become a part of me
And when I sit alone at night
Your thoughts burn through me like a fire
You’re the only one who knows who I really am

[Chorus]
We all wanna be somebody
We just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody
We’re willing to go but not that far
We all wanna be somebody
We just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody
We’re willing to go but not that far

[Outro]
I’m just the boy inside the man
Not exactly who you think I am
Trying to trace my steps back here again so many times
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
I hope that they see you in me

[Verse 1]
Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothin' could take the pain away

[Chorus]
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne!

[Verse 2]
The sticks and the stones that you used to throw have
Built me an empire, so don't even try
To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight

[Chorus]
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne!
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my… throne

[Bridge]
I'll leave you chokin' on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know (Know)
I'll leave you chokin' on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know

[Chorus]
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne!
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne

[Verse 1]
How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb, without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

[Chorus]
Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

[Verse 2]
Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

[Chorus]
Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

[Bridge]
Bring me to life
I've been livin' a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life
Frozen inside, without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life
Among the dead

[Verse 3]
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

[Chorus]
Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

[Outro]
Bring me to life
I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life

[Verse 1y]
Everything inside of me is what it is, it's not changing
For you, for you; to myself, I stay true
So try to understand it when I tell you that I want you out
'Cause I've been reprimanded for the last time, so just shut your mouth
Bite your tongue 'cause I've had enough
You're speaking under your breath too much, shut up

[Chorus
It's my life, it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same and I'mma stay this way
It's my life, it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same and I'mma stay this way

[Verse 2]
I live my life the way I choose, so walk away before I lose
My mind, it's time for you to say goodbye
Over and over you try to force my hand and make me change
As I get older I understand it more and hate these games
You put me through and now I'll never lose
And now the strides I take will guide me straight away from fake-ass punks like you

[Chorus]
It's my life, it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same and I'mma stay this way
It's my life, it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same and I'mma stay this way

[Interlude]
It's never gonna change, it is the same and I'mma stay this way
It's never gonna change, it is the same and I'mma stay this way

[Bridge]
Let me be, just let me breathe, guaranteed you can't fix me
Everything that's underneath and inside me is not changing
Let me be, just let me breathe 'cause everything that's underneath
Everything that's underneath is never changing!
Everything that's underneath is never changing!

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything inside of me is what it is, it's not changing
For you, for you
It's never gonna change, it is the same and I'mma stay this way!

[Chorus]
It's my life, it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same and I'mma stay this way
It's my life, it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same and I'mma stay this way!

[Outro]
It's my life it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same and I'mma stay this way
It's my life it's my fate
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it never was your place
It's never gonna change, it is the same and I'mma stay this way[Verse 1]
I tried to face the fight within
But it's over
I'm ready for the riot to begin
And surrender
I walked the path that led me to the end
Remember
I'm caught beneath, there's nothing left to give
Forever

[Chorus]
When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever
Forever

[Verse 2]
Gray skies will chase the light away
No longer
I fought the fight, now only dark remains
Forever
Divided I will stand
And I will let this end

[Chorus]
When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever
Forever

[Bridge]
The sun begins to rise
And wash away the sky
The turning of the tide
Don't leave it all behind
And I will never say goodbye

[Chorus]
When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever
Forever[Verse 1]
Where are the people that accused me?
The ones who beat me down and bruised me
They hide just out of sight
Can't face me in the light
They'll return, but I'll be stronger

[Chorus]
God, I want to dream again
Take me where I've never been
I want to go there
This time I'm not scared
Now I am unbreakable, it's unmistakable
No one can touch me
Nothing can stop me

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's hard to just keep going
But faith is moving without knowing
Can I trust what I can't see
To reach my destiny?
I want to take control, but I know better

[Chorus]
God, I want to dream again
Take me where I've never been
I want to go there
This time I'm not scared
Now I am unbreakable, it's unmistakable
No one can touch me
Nothing can stop me

[Bridge]
Forget the fear, it's just a crutch
That tries to hold you back
And turn your dreams to dust
All you need to do is just trust

[Chorus]
God, I want to dream again
Take me where I've never been
I want to go there
This time I'm not scared
Now I am unbreakable, it's unmistakable
No one can touch me
Nothing can stop me

[Outro]
God, I want to dream again
Take me where I've never been
I want to go there
This time I'm not scared
Now I am unbreakable, it's unmistakable
No one can touch me
Nothing can stop me

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Bridge]
And I know I may end up failing, too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

[Chorus]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Outro]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be[Verse 1: Trevor Wentworth & Matt Wentworth]
I've been fighting the same old war
Against a disease, without a cure
Been holding on for so long (For so long, for so long)
I've been wishing upon a star, as my universe falls apart
I feel so far from the sky, as my dreams are flying by

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say it's a battle that can't be won
We need our knives, we need our guns

[Chorus]
Should I run away and change my name?
Or should I stay and fight through the night
And never close my eyes?
I'll never close my eyes

[Verse 2]
I've come too far to go back now, to turn into a face in the crowd
Been on this road, for so long (For so long, for so long)
Convinced there is no way out, my world is turned upside down
My sense of direction's been gone (For so long, for so long)

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say it's a battle that can't be won
We need our knives, we need our guns

[Chorus]
Should I run away and change my name?
Or should I stay and fight through the night
And never close my eyes?
I'll never close my eyes

[Bridge]
Stay strong, keep moving, can't let the darkness blind us
Carry on, we'll be the ones that pull the stars down to us
Stay strong, keep moving, can't let the darkness blind us
Carry on, we'll be the ones that pull the stars down to us

[Chorus]
Should I run away and change my name?
Or should I stay and fight through the night
And never close my eyes?
I'll never close my eyesThe sky is breaking me tonight
I wish that you were by my side
The world keeps falling under me
I wish that you could see

Lines were crossed in my mind
I know I should have seen the signs
I might be lost on the way
But I am not afraid

I wanted you to know
Wanted you to know
Wanted you to know I won't be waiting
Burning as I
Needed you to know
I have to let you go
I've wasted all my time as you were changing
Killing all our memories...

Should have seen it from the start
We are tend to fall apart
If we believe that we can change
Than it's all in vain
We could try and try again
But we'd get closer to the end
Crawling as we try to breathe
We're not ment to be

I wanted you to know
Wanted you to know
Wanted you to know I won't be waiting
Burning as I
Needed you to know
I have to let you go
I've waisted all my time as you were changing
Killing all our memories...

I wanted you to know
Wanted you to know
Wanted you to know I won't be waiting
Burning as I
Needed you to know
I have to let you go
I've waisted all my time as you were changing
Killing all our memories...

[Verse 1
Sever every tie
Untangle every line
Your words don't mean anything anymore, no
You're never satisfied
But I won't compromise myself for you anymore
Anymore no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're so complicated
I'm so over it

[Chorus]
Don't tell me everything is alright (I know you know)
Don't tell me how to live my life
I'm Breaking Through tonight

[Verse 2]
You can crash and burn this time
As I leave it all behind
These scars won't breathe anymore anymore no
You self-ignite goodbye
So I buried you alive
Now you're six feet down
Getting lower
Going nowhere

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's not complicated
I'm just over it

[Bridge]
Take this hate this
You can feel the fire
Suffocate in (Suffocate)
Your new life
So escapin'
Say goodnight
Darkness takin'
All your light

[Verse 3]
Don't tell me
Everything is alright (I know you know)
Don't tell me
How to live my life
I'm Breaking Through tonight (Don't tell me)
I'm Breaking Through tonight (Don't tell me)
I'm Breaking Through tonight[Verse 1]
I see nothing in your eyes
And the more I see the less I like
Is it over yet?
In my head

I know nothing of your kind
And I won't reveal your evil mind
Is it over yet?
I can't win

[Pre-Chorus]
So sacrifice yourself
And let me have what's left
I know that I can find the fire in your eyes
I'm going all the way, get away, please

[Chorus]
You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You gotta fight just to make it through
'Cause I will be the death of you

[Verse 2]
This will be all over soon (This will all be over soon)
Pour the salt into the open wound
Is it over yet?
Let me in

[Pre-Chorus]
So sacrifice yourself
And let me have what's left
I know that I can find the fire in your eyes
I'm going all the way, get away, please

[Chorus]
You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You gotta fight just to make it through
'Cause I will be the death of you

[Bridge]
I'm waiting, I'm praying, realize, start hating

[Chorus]
You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You gotta fight just to make it through
'Cause I will be the death of you[Verse 1]
Another mission, the powers have called me away
Another time to carry the colors again
My motivation, an oath I've sworn to defend
To win the honor of coming back home again
No explanation will matter after we begin
Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within
My true vocation and now my unfortunate friend
You will discover a war you're unable to win

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll have you know that I've become

[Chorus 1]
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent tend to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

[Verse 2]
Another reason, another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered now, for me to light
My dedication to all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders without a regret
A declaration embedded deep under my skin
A permanent reminder of how it began
No hesitation when I am commanded to strike
You need to know that you're in for the fight of your life

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You will be shown how I've become

[Chorus 1]
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent tend to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

[Chorus 2]
I'm indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent tend to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible, indestructible

[Chorus 1]
Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent tend to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war[Verse 1]
I watch the city burn
These dreams like ashes float away
Your voice I never heard
Only silence
Where were you when our hearts were bleeding
Where were you when it all crashed down
Never thought that you'd deceive me
Where are you now

[Hook]
How long can you stand the pain
How long will you hide your face
How long will you be afraid
Are you afraid
How long will you play this game
Will you fight or will you walk away
How long will you let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn

[Verse 2]
I watch the city burn
These passions slowly smoldering
A lesson never learned
Only violence
Is your world just a broken promise
Is your love just a drop of rain
Will we all just burn our fire
Are you still there

[Hook]
How long can you stand the pain
How long will you hide your face
How long will you be afraid
Are you afraid
How long will you play this game
Will you fight or will you walk away
How long will you let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn

[Verse 3]
Will you wait until it all burns down
Will you hide until it all burns down
Will it hurt when it all burns down
Will you fight when it all burns down

Will you stand when it all burns down
Will you love when it all burns down
Will it end when it all burns down
Will you just let it all burns down

[Hook]
How long can you stand the pain
How long will you hide your face
How long will you be afraid
Are you afraid
How long will you play this game
Will you fight or will you walk away
How long will you let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn

Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn

[Verse 1]
Walk away from the world
Give in all you got
Do not bother to try
Fight till the last drop

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Walk among the shadows
Leave your mark behind
Lose yourself into gray mass
Make statement of your life

[Chorus]
And I feel tired
Empty and hollow
Heart broken inside
And I feel this life
Has nothing for me anymore

And I feel revived
Sacred and honored
One of a kind
And I feel this life
Is something I was chosen for

[Verse 2]
Let in the anxiety
Make the most of every day
Dwell on guilt and misery
There is tomorrow after today

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You cannot win always
But you can lose every time
You alone have the power
You only hold the control

[Chorus]
And I feel tired
Empty and hollow
Heart broken inside
And I feel this life
Has nothing for me anymore

And I feel revived
Sacred and honored
One of a kind
And I feel this life
Is something I was chosen for

[Chorus]
And I feel tired
Empty and hollow
Heart broken inside
And I feel this life
Has nothing for me anymore

And I feel revived
Sacred and honored
One of a kind
And I feel this life
Is something I was chosen for

[Outro]
One fleeting moment
Few short lived seconds
Mere short flicker in time
For the shadow to grow and die

[Intro]
For above the darkling world
Soars the blackest bird
For above the darkling world
It sings the saddest song

And those who hear its cry

[Verse 1]
Those who hear it will go astray
Those who hear it will wither away
And nothing besides they hear
Nothing besides they think anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
They will turn
They will turn
They will turn away from the sun
They will turn
They will turn
They will turn against themselves

[Chorus - Whispered]
At the midmost night
Each midmost night
Upon Death's palm
The bird will rest a while

And gently Death will speak
Softly Death will hum and whisper
"Fly again my bird
Fly again over the world"

[Chorus]
At the midmost night
Each midmost night
Upon Death's palm
The bird will rest a while

And gently Death will speak
Softly Death will hum and whisper
"Fly again my bird
Fly again over the world"

[Verse 2]
Those who hear it will bow their heads
Those who hear it will find no rest
And black as a dream is now their way
For into the shades they all shall fade

[Pre-Chorus]
They will turn
They will turn
They will turn away from the sun
They will turn
They will turn
They will turn against themselves

[Chorus - Whispered]
At the midmost night
Each midmost night
Upon Death's palm
The bird will rest a while

And gently Death will speak
Softly Death will hum and whisper
"Fly again my bird
Fly again over the world"

[Chorus]
At the midmost night
Each midmost night
Upon Death's palm
The bird will rest a while

And gently Death will speak
Softly Death will hum and whisper
"Fly again my bird
Fly again over the world"

[Outro]
For above the darkling world
Soars the blackest bird
For above the darkling world
It sings the saddest song

[Verse 1]
Beneath a silent stone
In cold caress of the earth
Where timeless sleep reigns
Where world is but a distant toll

No stars shine, no moon roams
No sun broods, no winds blow
No tunes chime amidst the bones
No prayers for the devil's own

[Pre-Chorus]
Night falls and dawn breaks again
Autumns and winters slowly pass
And all these earthly tremors
But a remembrance for me

[Chorus]
Mine is this forgotten song
Buried deep and heard no more
Mine is this unhallowed sleep
Deathless wait under the trees

All the years in vain I fought
All my deeds have gone to nought
Unsung is the tale of mine
Mislaid till the end of time

[Post-Chorus]
Hidden deep under the vale of moon
Entombed beneath the white flowers of death

[Pre-Chorus]
Night falls and dawn breaks again
Autumns and winters slowly pass
And all these earthly tremors
But a remembrance for me

[Chorus]
Mine is this forgotten song
Buried deep and heard no more
Mine is this unhallowed sleep
Deathless wait under the trees

All the years in vain I fought
All my deeds have gone to nought
Unsung is the tale of mine
Mislaid till the end of time

[Bridge]
Only the frail words
Written in the stone
Retell my name anymore

Only the frail words
Written in the stone
Recall my days anymore

[Chorus]
Mine is this forgotten song
Buried deep and heard no more
Mine is this unhallowed sleep
Deathless wait under the trees

All the years in vain I fought
All my deeds have gone to nought
Unsung is the tale of mine
Mislaid till the end of time

[Outro]
Till the end of time
Unsung is the tale of mine
The tale of mine
Till the end of time

[Verse 1]
Walking on the gallows ground
Rope tightly around the neck
Raven-bird on each shoulder
Waiting for the pick

Chasing for the shadows
Ideal that does not exist
On the endless road
Leading to nowhere

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the sounds and light wash over
Bathe the darkest corners of melancholy
Blow burning flames into your soul
Reveal the truth between the lines

[Chorus]
In this world every hour wounds
Every second draws blood
Every moment delivers pain
If you choose so

In this world every hour kills
Every minute seeps despair
There is nothing but suffering
If you decide so

[Verse 2]
Walking on the gallows ground
Rope tightly around the neck
Flock of vultures circling above
Waiting for the feast

Reaching through the blackest sky
For the brightest star
Seeking for the guidance
From the night that never dawns

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the sounds and light wash over
Bathe the darkest corners of melancholy
Blow burning flames into your soul
Reveal the truth between the lines

[Chorus]
In this world every hour wounds
Every second draws blood
Every moment delivers pain
If you choose so

In this world every hour kills
Every minute seeps despair
There is nothing but suffering
If you decide so

[Bridge 1]
Guided by empty promises
Charmed by hollow words
No truth or answers could be found
Nothing but years numbered in me

[Bridge 2]
Gods are great, but the heart
The heart is greater
From our wounds they're born
From our sadness they grow

Gods are strong, but the mind
The mind is stronger
In our scars they dwell
But in our hearts they burn

[Chorus]
In this world every hour wounds
Every second draws blood
Every moment delivers pain
If you choose so

In this world every hour kills
Every minute seeps despair
There is nothing but suffering
If you decide so

[Verse 1]
Frequented by the displeasing memories
Haunted by the creatures born of night
Sunk deep in the dejection and distress
Weak and powerless to severe the ties

[Pre-Chorus]
Bound in the dream world
Wide-awake for every hour of sleep
Faltering towards the future
Only to come across with the past

[Chorus]
No hope beacons here
No rays of light lingers
Underneath the black earth
Where the forgotten wait

No love resides here
No solace can be found
Underneath the cold soil
Where the sleeping gods lie

[Verse 2]
There is nothing to remember
When you are lost
There is nothing to strive for
When you are gone

Now rest for you are tired, let it go
Dive into sleepless dream, embrace oblivion
The moments of light between the darkness
Are brief and flee fast in the house of dead

[Pre-Chorus]
Bound in the dream world
Wide-awake for every hour of sleep

[Chorus]
No hope beacons here
No rays of light lingers
Underneath the black earth
Where the forgotten wait

No love resides here
No solace can be found
Underneath the cold soil
Where the sleeping gods lie

[Post-Chorus]
There is nothing to remember
When you are lost
There is nothing to strive for
When you are gone

[Bridge]
Searching my way out of confusion
In this cold night cold as my heart
Trying to find a resolution
Assurance and strength to just go on

[Outro]
I'm in the thousand winds that blow
In the circling flight of blackbird
In the stars that shine at night
In the last dying rays of light

Be gone sorrow
Leave your dead behind
Stay away grief
Lay the ghosts to rest

Be gone sorrow
Leave your dead behind
Stay away grief
Lay the ghosts to rest

[Verse 1]
Since the very beginning
Surrounded by silence
Brooded in solitude
Grown in the darkling shades

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Destined to find my own way
To create the path to follow
And the scars of tomorrow
Will make you bleed only today

[Chorus]
And the rain keeps falling
Pouring down from the sky
Washing footmarks from the mire
Leaving no trace behind

And as the shadows grow taller
Swallow all the light
I'm left alone in darkness
With no one by my side

[Verse 2]
Since the very beginning
Chosen to bear the burden
Abide tragedy in the blood
Close shadows in the heart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Always beaten by the stronger
Never defeated by anyone
Never disarmed of power
Held by the ones guided by fire

[Chorus]
And the rain keeps falling
Pouring down from the sky
Washing footmarks from the mire
Leaving no trace behind

And as the shadows grow taller
Swallow all the light
I'm left alone in darkness
With no one by my side

[Chorus]
And the rain keeps falling
Pouring down from the sky
Washing footmarks from the mire
Leaving no trace behind

And as the shadows grow taller
Swallow all the light
I'm left alone in darkness
With no one by my side

[Verse 1]
I am the last
The one who holds on past
Clinging on something we used to have

I am the last
The one who chose this path
To walk among the world of shadows

[Chorus]
Always one for sorrow
Never one for love
Two souls destined to failure
Right from the start

It was always one for sorrow
Never one for love
Two souls set for departure
Before the nightfall

[Verse 2]
And here I stand
Devoid of faith, bereft of hope
Unable to break the walls around me

And here I stand
Shell of a man from past
Condemned to world of resentment

[Chorus]
Always one for sorrow
Never one for love
Two souls destined to failure
Right from the start

It was always one for sorrow
Never one for love

[Bridge]
It took two to summon the thunder
One to bring down the rain
Two to torn all asunder
One to suffer the pain

Two to crush dreams and wonders
One to lose everything
All once beautiful and sacred
Nothing but in vain

[Chorus]
Always one for sorrow
Never one for love
Two souls destined to failure
Right from the start

It was always one for sorrow
Never one for love
Two souls set for departure
Before the nightfall

[Verse 1]
O darkness, if in thy arms
I could rest for a while
And with these earthly eyes
See thy dim smile

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maid of twilight, lass of duskfall
Hang the Moon on the sky's arch
Soothe the weight of a darkling day
Croon me into the slumber:

[Chorus]
Rock here in the birch's lap
Swing in the manor of wind
Lay down your weary head
Let the blue stars darken

Rock here in the birch's lap
Swing in the manor of wind
Lay down your weary head
Let the blue stars darken

[Verse 2]
O silence, if in thy cradle I could sway
Like a child, heart the amending song
The sighing of the shades

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maid of twilight, lass of duskfall
Serve thy goblet to me
Let me drink to the last drop
The sweet opiate of the dreams:

[Chorus]
Rock here in the birch's lap
Swing in the manor of wind
Lay down your weary head
Let the blue stars darken

Rock here in the birch's lap
Swing in the manor of wind
Lay down your weary head
Let the blue stars darken

[Outro]
Ours is the silence
The echo old ageless night
A gleam in the blackest of streams
One fleeing moment

For vain is all the toil and trouble
Vain is all the heartbreak
In the end I'll find my solace
In an earthen cradle

So good night

[Verse 1]
This I have learnt:
World forces all of us down
The fleeing years bend our backs
Love but smears our hearts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Here I now lie still like a broken bow
Soul sullen and rigid with the will to die
Sighing after the days long since gone
Cursing every step on this ill-fated trail

[Chorus]
In vain I try to forget
In vain I try to forgive

[Post-Chorus]
Black bird from evening sky
Raven from heaths of night
Come and take my cares
Carry away the grief

Bereave me of my woes
Rend off these earthly throes
Fly them to deepest lakes
To the starlit shores

[Verse 2]
This I have learnt:
Even the sweetest wine turns sour
We work our fingers to the bone
All our efforts of no avail

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Here we all are but troubled guests
On darkling earth
Lost echoes that pine away
Into the dusk

Nothing more than the wind to rely on
Nothing more than the death
To comfort us in the end

[Chorus]
In vain I try to forget
In vain I try to forgive

[Post-Chorus]
Black bird from evening sky
Raven from heaths of night
Come and take my cares
Carry away the grief

Bereave me of my woes
Rend off these earthly throes
Fly them to deepest lakes
To the starlit shores

[Outro]
This I have heard:
All ends in serene sleep
All these sorrows are washed away
As we lapse into the night
As we lapse into the night

But I know it's a lie
I know it's a lie

[Verse 1]
How does it feel?
To welcome the new day
Not worth saving

To fall down on own imprudent acts
The wind answers quietly
Clears the black smoke far thick to see
Unfolds the true nature of man

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And this fire it burns
Consuming us all
Withered garden for posterity
Inheritance in flames

[Chorus]
When the mankind moves
Rest of the life shakes
All once green turned into stone
Flesh into dust and soil

Where the last wave broke
The shores blazed red
And place once called home
Turned into hall of dead

[Post-Chorus]
How does it feel?

[Verse 2]
Bite the hand that feeds you
Poison the well that waters you
Prospects made from castles of sand
Legacy in barren land

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Breed, greed, bleed
Legacy in barren land
The last wave broke
Prospects made from castles of sand

[Chorus]
When the mankind moves
Rest of the life shakes
All once green turned into stone
Flesh into dust and soil

Where the last wave broke
The shores blazed red
And place once called home
Turned into hall of dead

[Chorus]
When the mankind moves
Rest of the life shakes
All once green turned into stone
Flesh into dust and soil

Where the last wave broke
The shores blazed red
And place once called home
Turned into hall of dead

[Intro]
(I...) I sing with a shattered voice
(I...) I sing with a heavy heart

(I...) I sing with a shattered voice
(I...) I sing with a heavy heart

[Verse 1]
There in the deepest well of dreams
Echoed a distant song
I hearkened to the hallowed voice
Stirred from ageless sleep

Through this barren soil you came
Sweet scent of spring
Came and cast the earth in bloom
Lent your light to me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But now the summer's dreams are bent
Like grain against the scythe
And memories of blissful days
They fall like leaves

For autumn's songs are made of loss
Of yearning and regret
In bitter tone they are recited
Uttered with a heavy heart

[Chorus]
"I sing with shattered voice
A tale of marred souls
I cry for consumed hearts
And springs forever gone"

[Post-Chorus]
(I...) I sing with a shattered voice
(I...) I sing with a heavy heart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The lights of sun and stars will fade
And moon covers its face
All the tunes will quiet down
And the songs shall die

As this wretched heart unfolds
Like mouth of furnace grins
Inside there's but a blackened cell
Full of filth and flames

[Chorus]
"I sing with shattered voice
A tale of marred souls
I cry for consumed hearts
And springs forever gone"

"I sing with shattered voice
A tale of marred souls
I cry for consumed hearts
And springs forever gone"

[Bridge 1]
There once was time
When I resounded by your side
There once was time
When I trembled under your eyes

[Bridge 2]
What do I hear when you're gone?
The wind's harrowing cry
What do I hear when you're gone?
The sighing of the languid grief

[Outro]
Cold creeps in, silver crowns the land
Long are the evening now, grave the guilt's weight
Stars shriek their emptiness in the darkling sky
All the world is but a barrow shrouded in white

What do I hear when you're gone?

[Verse 1]
Now close your eyes
And open your weary heart
Let me soothe away the woes
Of fiendish world...

[Verse 2]
As will the sun bathe the land
In its warming light
So shall the moon ascend
To guide the day to wane

In turn the rain to hush
The tumult of this world
And the wind to rise
Sigh a lullaby in trees

[Pre-Chorus]
Not in these troubled times
I'm not the one you pined for
No, not into calmer waters
I'm not the one you long for

[Chorus]
But a scarecrow, an anathema to the world
Looking in from the outside
It's time to turn my back
Walk off the beaten path
Seek heartening in solitude

[Verse 3]
The arch of sky is roof where I call it home
Drizzle of rain, the only music from now on
My bed is made from juniper's boughs
Of mire and moss my pillow

[Pre-Chorus]
Not in these troubled times
Not into calmer waters

[Chorus]
But a scarecrow, an anathema to the world
Looking in from the outside
It's time to turn my back
Walk off the beaten path
Seek heartening in solitude

[Outro]
Lone footprints diverge from tree line
Autumn veils the sloughs with rime
Shell of quagmire
Yet too fragile to bear a man

[Chorus]
Nothing can offer content
Nothing can ease the pain
Nothing can wear off the sorrow
One is born to bear within

While your world is worth of trying
My world is mere cold
No chance in disillusion
Only the end of the road

[Verse 1]
Man weighed down with sorrow
Anguished from the sole being
Destined to live with uneasiness
Always the hard way

[Chorus]
Nothing can offer content
Nothing can ease the pain
Nothing can wear off the sorrow
One is born to bear within

While your world is worth of trying
My world is mere cold
No chance in disillusion
Only the end of the road

[Chorus]
Nothing can offer content
Nothing can ease the pain
Nothing can wear off the sorrow
One is born to bear within

While your world is worth of trying
My world is mere cold
No chance in disillusion
Only the end of the road

[Outro]
Cold is the world
For the ones excluded
Dark is the path
In the absence of light

Compelled to cherish
Beauty in longing
Cling on love
Amidst of the suffering

No chance in disillusion
No, not in this world
Not for a man
Weighed down with sorrow
Only the end of the road

[Verse 1]
Wreathed in silence, laid down in shades
Swathed in regrets, deluded astray
Forgotten in half-light, drawn in despair
Soothed in slumber so dreadful and fair

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Rending and searing and twisting my dreams
Alone in the gloom with the nightmares unseen

[Chorus - Whispered]
The night has a thousand eyes
And the day but one
Yet the light of the bright world dies
With the dying sun

[Chorus]
The night has a thousand eyes
And the day but one
Yet the light of the bright world dies
With the dying sun

The mind has a thousand eyes
And the heart but one
Yet the light of a whole life dies
When love is done

[Verse 2]
Worthless the pledges, all vows but lies
Fateful her kisses, where a serpent hides
First beckoned to step from the twilight to glare
Then left in the dark for the demons to share

[Chorus - Whispered]
The night has a thousand eyes
And the day but one
Yet the light of the bright world dies
With the dying sun

[Chorus]
The night has a thousand eyes
And the day but one
Yet the light of the bright world dies
With the dying sun

The mind has a thousand eyes
And the heart but one
Yet the light of a whole life dies
When love is done

[Post-Chorus]
Only the stars see
Only the moon hears
Only the stars see
Only the moon

[Bridge]
And quietly the water-lilies sigh
Like the last breath of a weary soul
And the weed sway in the dreary waters
Like a girl's dark hair they wave about

And the black stones under my bare feet
Cold and smooth like her milk-white palm
And the silence which falls upon this shore
Resounds now louder than oncoming storm
For all is gone

[Outro]
Only the stars see
Only the moon hears
Only the stars see
Only the moon hears
Only the moon[Verse 1]
Spring brought the two together
Married the wind with the fire
Under the secrecy of lush birch trees
Opposite hearts became one

One day followed another
Weeks passed, months lapsed
Until wind grew to a storm
And fire to a burning pile

[Chorus 1]
Cold gust of whirlwind
Fiery flames, burning sharp
Adoration all too strong
Pushed the two apart

[Chorus 2]
Different from the start
Fate that never
Was written in the stars
Led to a change of hearts

[Verse 2]
The fall split the one in two
Under the pouring rain
Dressed them both in loneliness
And led to their separate ways

The fire could not be tamed with the wind
Or the wind suppressed by the flames
As blending the light with the dark
Merely results in grey

[Chorus]
Cold gust of whirlwind
Fiery flames, burning sharp
Adoration all too strong
Pushed the two apart

[Chorus 1]
Cold gust of whirlwind
Fiery flames, burning sharp
Adoration all too strong
Pushed the two apart

[Chorus 2]
Different from the start
Fate that never
Was written in the stars
Led to a change of hearts
A change of hearts

[Intro]
I have come to the end of my line

[Verse 1]
With these final steps
I take back my freedom
Unchain the shackles
That never could hold my mind

Time keeps running and running
Outstripping the dead tired ones
The hours will run out from us all
And in the end no one differs from the other

Only the blue sky and the green grass
Go on forever in this world
Where seconds feel like eternity
And years pass in blink of an eye

[Pre-Chorus]
When the last rays of light
Set behind these shores
Night wraps me in its blanket
And leads my way to the stars

[Chorus]
Through the fear and the ache
Past the storm and the rain
I have made peace with the world
I am born again

[Verse 2]
I may be gone in the flesh
But my love will stay here
I am always with you in spirit
So just stay strong

[Pre-Chorus]
When the last rays of light
Set behind these shores
Night wraps me in its blanket
And leads my way to the stars

[Chorus]
Through the fear and the ache
Past the storm and the rain
I have made peace with the world
I am born again

Through the fear and the ache
Past the storm and the rain
I have made peace with the world
I am born again

[Bridge]
No one wins tonight
No one gets a closure
No one walks away victorious

[Outro]
But don't forget me
Don't you forget me
Burn a candle for me
When you can

Don't forget me!
Don't forget me!
Don't forget me!

Don't forget me
Don't forget me

[Verse 1]
With this fall (I fall...)
Great grey clouds covered the sky
Dimming the light of sun
Muting stars and crescent moon

Lost inside the world of gloomy
Haunting shades
Descending into this
Abyss of human soul

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In this dreariest of nights
Time can draw out like a blade

[Chorus]
And yet Her grace shines through
Through me, and the brooding clouds
And if her light never falls on me
I'm content just to feel the lack

[Verse 2]
And this fall
Set requiem for my way
Away from others paths
I turned to desolation

Away from others thoughts
Timid and surpassing
Away from the others
Beyond caring

[Pre-Chorus 2]
In this darkest of hours
Time draws out like a knife

[Chorus]
And yet Her grace shines through
Through me, and the brooding clouds
And if her light never falls on me
I'm content just to feel the lack

[Post-Chorus]
The reflection once whole
Now only a wound
Seeping hurt and loss
The image once so bold
Now only a scar
Dry of hope and light

[Bridge]
For all things ought to say
Left unsaid
For all deeds ought to do
Left undone

For all things ought to say
Left unsaid
For all deeds ought to do
Left undone

[Outro]
Be with me now
Be with me now
Be with me now
Be with me

Be with me now
Be with me now
Be with me now
Be with me

[Verse 1]
In the evening of a grey day
A bleak day
I strayed into the dim silence
Of the hallowed trees

Where the fir-trees whisper
Of those been, those gone
Where the sacred earth still hides
All those we once loved

[Chorus]
"O father, hear these words
Your son is not made for this world
Faint-hearted and careworn
Into this vile life I was hurled

[Verse 2]
In the woods the fiends sigh
I swear I heard the demons neigh
On the seashore I espy
The dreadful void under the tides"

Ill-assorted with this life
These cares
Each moment I am waiting
For the worst to come my way

Dark berry from my mother's womb
A frail one
I was affrighted at my birth
Bewildered from the start

[Chorus]
"O father, hear these words
Your son is not made for this world
Faint-hearted and careworn
Into this vile life I was hurled

In the woods the fiends sigh
I swear I heard the demons neigh
On the seashore I espy
The dreadful void under the tides"

[Bridge]
Better it would be to stay in the shades
In the thicket of the dead, in the groves of death
Here I would lie to the end of the days

[Verse 3]
"Hear me now, my hapless son
Warn away all yours fears
Make good use of your brief days
Life may be grim but death is more austere
By yourself you sit and wait
By yourself you will have time to repent"

[Verse 4]
"In these lowly halls
No moon will beam, no sun will shine
In these narrow rooms
No tears are seen, no laughter heard"

[Outro]
At the dawn of a quiet day
I strolled from the woods, returned to the hearth
And with a restful mind I roamed
The dreary shores, the darkling wilds
Greeting all the days that befall
Taking life as it comes

[Verse 1]
A fistful of fear in my hands
A bullet of betrayal in my brain
No progress comes from pleasure
We smile in ignorance and learn in pain
Willful deceit was your plan
Desperately avoid the blame
Who will you answer to now?
Sharpened your shovels just to dig your grave

[Pre-Chorus]
Stand up 'cause the ground is in your way
I won't give you any peace
Yet still, you talk
Try to fight, but I will watch you fall
Fall

[Chorus]
This is sweet revenge
And karma's a bitch
You glutton for punishment
What did you expect?

[Verse 2]
Sick, sick, sick
I'm sick of being your martyr
Your inflated ego is just dead weight
Bask in all the eyes upon you
Before you know it they'll have turned away

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Stand up as the whole world turns away
I won't give you any peace
Yet still, you talk
Try to fight, but I will watch you fall
Fall

[Chorus]
This is sweet revenge
And karma's a bitch
You glutton for punishment
What did you expect?

[Bridge 1]
Wait and see, cry yourself a lonesome creek
Your decaying corpse can feed the roots of my towering tree
Just wait and see
You're dead to me

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Yet still, you speak
Trying to justify what you're doing to me
I will watch you fall
Fall

[Chorus]
This is sweet revenge
And karma's a bitch
You glutton for punishment
What did you, what did you expect?

[Verse 1]
We walk through war in the halls of dead protocols
We came so close, demands were met
That's when the rug was ripped out from under our feet
A vicious crime, cold betrayal and deceit

[Pre-Chorus]
Then reality hits you like a stab in the back
Just like a slap in the face, premeditated attack

[Chorus]
On and on
The battle knows no victory
On and on
Weapons high, reject defeat

[Verse 2]
Decrepit smiles shine like fire, lying through their teeth
It's a memory you want to forget
From one second to another the whole world went under
The future cuts so deep, tangibility bleeds

[Pre-Chorus]
Then reality hits you like a stab in the back
Like a slap in the face, premeditated attack

[Chorus]
On and on
The battle knows no victory
On and on
Weapons high, reject defeat

[Solo]
Weapons high

[Bridge]
On and on
Till the victory is dead and gone
On and on
Kill the history, the wrong side won
On, on and on
On, on and on

[Chorus]
On and on
The battle knows no victory
On and on
Weapons high, don't let the history repeat

[Outro]
The battle knows no victory
Weapons high, reject defeatYou can't carry me
I am too heavy inside
You don't have the strength
To get me untied

Beyond salvation
Don't really care at all
Unleash the tide
And let the waters fall

It broke me into little pieces
With edged razor sharp glass drawing my skin
Sharpened by my sins
Aim to rebuild with self-hatred and guilt

Save me
From the morning sun
Rewrite my fate
And let this life be undone

The ocean swallows me
Into the depths of ages
Darkness as old as the earth
Demons' hive
This crushing abyss
A bliss called life

At the edge of dawn
Forthcoming light will burn my eyes
And leave me blind
Solar flares torch my skin
And wind blows the ashes away

Save me
From the morning sun
Rewrite my fate
And let this life be undoneRestart
Ignite with brand new hate
Inhale the pain
Deny the blame
Beat them sore
This is not a metaphor
Black machinery with tons of steel breaking free
One man genocide
Legion in one heavily armed

My broken bones grown whole
Wounds turned to scars and bleeding stopped
By divine wrath I am reborn

Withdraw behind your own lines
Pull back the men
The ones who went and slaved my queen
This is for them to see
They bleed
The same blood that painted my dreams
The blood of my enemies

My broken bones grown whole
Wounds turned to scars and bleeding stopped
By divine wrath I am reborn

My broken bones grown whole
Wounds turned to scars and bleeding stopped
By divine wrath I am reborn

[Verse 1]
The unsaid tone of weak despair
Fail to resonate
Frayed end of our binding thread
Will disintegrate
By the laws our physics stage
Failure to communicate

[Verse 2]
None too sentient
Hear no, see no worthless magic
Against all function
Ongoing choices the trials will end
Filter the nonsense
And laugh at what's left
Indecision/nonvision
What matters taken away

[Chorus]
Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak
Soon the battle is over
Lost to apathy

[Verse 3]
So overcome with pointless tears
To test pain receptors
Nothing matters ever here
Put up a non-reaction
These eyes will never see
Covered up from reality

[Chorus]
Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak
Soon the battle is over
Lost to apathy

[Verse 4]
The unknown world that you deny
No priority
Cannot fail if you never start
How predictable
I want to know where for madness to start
Always the sceptic and never be part
Introvertive, indescriptive
It matters not, not

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, and weak

[Chorus]
Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak
Soon the battle is over
Lost to apathy

[Outro]
The shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak
Oh, the battle is over
Lost to apathy

[Verse 1]
Make enemies of truth and reason
In that a rage is born
Start out a promise and a venture
Where direction was never the goal

[Chorus]
How does it feel
To run out of nothing
Where do you go
When you run out?

[Verse 2]
Never you mind
The grand perspective
Other forces kept at bay

[Verse 3]
As you narrow the field of vision
To retain a sense of control
Your focus will remain unfixed
In the haze of a world unhinged

[Verse 4]
Create a sense of purpose
Around which you base your faith
The doubt that haunts your skin
An itch that will linger on
Forever

[Chorus]
How does it feel
To run out of nothing
Where do you go
When you run out?

[Verse 5]
You wave off
Critique as an offender
Never question
Where your motives lie

[Verse 6]
As a part of the greatest fable
The beast all had forgotten
Instincts in a dead end rampage
Destruction as a saving grace

[Bridge]
You run out of nothing

[Chorus]
How does it feel
To run out of nothing
Where do you go
When you run out?

How does it feel
To run out of nothing
Where do you go?
Where do you go?

[Verse 1]
You try to hide the fact hidden from yourself
Your own favorite entertainer
Is none other than the one we call you
And you need the others to fortify your disgust

[Pre-Chorus 1]
For the worst of us, to the rest of us

[Chorus]
Entertain the thought that we are still alive
Entertain the notion of impending doom
Entertain our worst suspicions and our fears
Just pull us in and take us down

[Verse 2]
I hear a mighty cheer
Your faith could not be any stronger
In your head the stage is set
A product of what we're being fed

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oblivious by design
Not susceptible to any mind

[Chorus]
Entertain the thought that we are still alive
Entertain the notion of impending doom
Entertain our worst suspicions and our fears
Just pull us in and take us down

[Bridge]
I can take what's being given
I can down whatever comes
I will do what you deem necessary
My fear compels me

[Verse 3]
No more fictitious needs
I will not be made a mockery
No more chaos seed
I am not what you're supposed to see

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Without a sense of danger everything is lost
In the name of entertainment we are doomed

[Chorus]
Entertain the thought that we are still alive
Entertain the notion of impending doom
Entertain our worst suspicions and our fears
Just pull us in and take us down

[Verse 1]
All has now been broken
On streets I dare not walk
Freedom is an illusion
I build my fences high

If there was something out there
I've learned not to expect
There's a hundred million reasons
Not to care

[Chorus]
Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me

Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown

[Verse 2]
As always in these matters
You broke the deal of deals
And wasted what was given
To revel in your mess

I gave up all for nothing
I tried my best and failed
There's a thousand million reasons
Never to share again

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how it all begins
This is how it all begins

[Chorus]
Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me

Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crown

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how it all begins
This is how it all begins

[Chorus]
Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me

Don't bring it
Don't bring it
Don't bring your misery down on me
Wear misery's crownWhat night never abandoned
In shallow darkness dwell
The evidence in pools of black
Light cannot penetrate, light cannot penetrate

Have you come for my forgiveness
There's nothing left to give
No response to your repentance
This empty me

Lifted from the living days
To be bent right out of shape
Let blades and satisfiers
Cut and lick these wounds

In reversal of repentance
This bastard son of lies
To bring meaning to it all
Meaning to it all

Have you come for my forgiveness
There's nothing left to give
No response to your repentance
This empty me

Take now from this body
A coward's heart
And a soul beyond repair
Empty me

Between insecurity and reason
Self deprecation as a means to the end
Out of reach but never closer
A cure that searches for the cause of this
Cause for chaos

Have you come for my forgiveness
There's nothing left to give
No response to your repentance
This empty me

Drawn from memories the fragments linger
On ages of thought and seconds of sleep
What is it here that tempts the night
To stab the day and kill the lightCarry our streams
Lift up our less-than-elated lives
Transmit ourselves, we breathe out
Where no one [whispers]

Take in all the dark light
Turn the nighttime into day
Take in all the dark light
Turn the nighttime into day

Cathode Ray Sunshine
Speak out and we receive
Cathode Ray Sunshine
Show me and let us in

Alienate
Block out all, amid the breaking of the light
See it again and again
Single sight

Sensory perception
Turn the nighttime into day
Sensory perception
Turn the nighttime into day

Cathode Ray Sunshine
Speak out and we receive
Cathode Ray Sunshine
Show me and let us in

Cathode Ray Sunshine
Speak out and we receive
Cathode Ray Sunshine
Show me and let us in

To our great distrust
Escapism: a means of getting through alive
Take it in and spit it out again
That measly filth

Focal degradation
Bring the chaos into light
Cathode Ray Sunshine
BurnsNothing of a man was he
His true face of sleep a deception
Fell through all the way to the bottom
Learned to hold

Again we vowed not to hold sacred
But to damn that hollow gaze
Unsteady on these shorelines
Mute to an unthought scream

Another word fell silent
Like the static in their eyes
Against all fleeing logic
We let our minds go
Blank

Why define ourselves by misguiding light?
How can we receive the static in their eyes

Each blink of light an accuser
Each unlit shape an assassin

Crawled the outer rim
With his back exposed
The shadows unending
Fought off the stares

Again we vowed not to hold sacred
But to damn that hollow gaze
Unsteady on these shorelines
Mute to an unthought scream

Another word fell silent
Like the static in their eyes
Against all fleeing logic
We let our minds go
Blank

Nullify the ego, stay right back
Stay right back
How can we receive
The static?

Fear that strangles spirit
Denial speaks the truth
Fear that strangles spirit
Crushes me and you

Wicked are the senses, wicked are the words
Give me the static

Again we vowed not to hold sacred
But to damn that hollow gaze
Unsteady on these shorelines
Mute to an unthought scream

Another word fell silent
Like the static in their eyes
Against all fleeing logic
We let our minds go
Blank

[Verse 1]
Walking slowly
Distilled blood
Designed to never fail
Sedate and pure
Cold by choice
Stylized pain
I am feeling blue

[Verse 2]
Lacerated and swallowed down below
I was fearless but now I'm screaming scared
In nothingness
In this emptiness
So I let this void to fill up my heart

[Chorus]
Of fire and endless resistance
Where shadows bite like flames
They sing of fire and endless resistance
Where echoes call your name

[Verse 3]
Medicated and ready
To accept life
As it comes and as it ends
Expectations
And the highest of hopes
You're supposed to be happy
When everything around us is alive and green

[Chorus]
Of fire and endless resistance
Where shadows call your name
Of fire and endless resistance
Where echoes bite like flames

[Post-Chorus]
Forevermore

[Outro]
Hollow men on hollow ground
Crushed bones and bruising souls
Multiple substance abusers

[Intro]
Today all colors are bleeding
Across the ocean
I am sorry I couldn't stay

[Verse 1]
How does it feel to own what you are
To unstitch your heart without causing a flood
To fall but never ceasing to believe
In light taking over darkness
To breathe life in serenity

[Chorus]
If only I knew how to forgive
If only I knew how to let go
If only I knew how to own what I am

[Verse 2]
Galaxies away
I am riding the waves of the lost
Lead this ship astray
Make me hate you again

Fear, trust, guilt, love
In the grip of a coming storm
I am sinking under the weight
Of a troubled sun

[Bridge]
When bitterness conquered the heart
And left us crawling in the cold

Screaming worth a lifetime
With a voice of a follower
Always too soon
Always too late

Screaming worth a lifetime
With a voice of a follower
Always too soon
Always too late
Always in between

[Chorus]
If only I knew how to forgive
If only I knew how to let go
If only I knew how to own what I am

If only I knew how to forgive
If only I knew how to let go
If only I knew how to own what I am

Right here!
We stand alone!

Against pitiless indifference
We stand alone!

Forever confounded by the burning margins
To get without context when into denial
Give in to ignorance when the world responds in kind
Put an end to the search and nullify the sense of life

Alone in silence!
Yes I am frightened and so are you
Against pitiless indifference
We stand alone!

Against the ever coming night!

So we step back to reveal a new perspective
When the allure of our gift is worn off
Not the least be curious when giants steps away
No going back, our time is running out

Alone in silence!
Yes I am frightened and so are you
Against pitiless indifference
We stand alone!

Must we resort to the end of our inquiry
For this to make sense? This to make sense!

Right here!
Right now!
We stand alone!

Give up or recount them, the days of your life
The truth was of essence when time was alive
There is no incentive to give in to the absurd
Reality and comfort, live forever to oppose

Forever opposed!

Alone in silence!
Yes I am frightened and so are you
Against pitiless indifference
We stand alone!

[Verse 1]
We're worried about echoes
And why we're being held-back
Bound at the speed of light

[Chorus]
This is the time
Of no regret
In a forward momentum race
We leave in our wake
What is broken, forgotten and gone

[Verse 2]
I squint my eyes
As if to make my sight extend
A little further

[Chorus]
This is the time
Of no regret
In a forward momentum race
We leave in our wake
What is broken and forgotten

[Bridge]
The dream is nothing
Yet it drives us to the end
These words unforce our hand
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 3]
In fear of true deception
Our lives are being brought-back
Brought back down

[Chorus]
This is the time
Of no regret
In a forward momentum race
We leave in our wake
What is broken and forgotten

[Verse 1]
Much like the tension built between force and will
Stray voltage wanders from neutral to earth
Lest we forget to forgive the signals get crossed
These two grounded objects on the opposite side of
Right or wrong where empathy was once
Is not the end - this is the reasoning

[Chorus]
I call you out so take it once and for all
The weight of the world on you
I call you out to claim neutrality

[Verse 2]
We failed our own reality on reality's terms
The less we know the more we forge
What suits our single-minded goals
It all comes down to this
A reverse polarity
In opposites we see what unity must be
Forever taking down the man-made walls of strife
Forever taking them down

[Chorus]
I call you out so take it once and for all
The weight of the world on you
I call you out to be accountable today tomorrow

I call you out

[Verse 3]
There's nothing like the friction sound
The slow burn of prolonged frustation
Wearing down the jagged edges
To fit within the margins
The fires spread throughout the night

It must now go down to where it can begin
Inside out I call you

[Chorus]
I call you out so take it once and for all
The weight of the world on you
I call you out to claim neutrality
I call you out to be accountable today tomorrow[Verse 1]
To ends unknown by means unworthy
To answer wishes, long dead and gone
Old empty promises, a just reward for the blind
Belief makes work for idle minds, we lost our way

[Pre-Chorus]
The only dream that matters is
The one you wake up from
Go

[Chorus]
Onward to the singularity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
Turn on this unentity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
We are faithless by default
We are faithless by default

[Verse 2]
I call for a world where we are nothing
More than the sum of what we know
Are we to be held hostage
By our tolerance for the intolerant
Then we've lost our way

[Pre-Chorus]
To hope is to surrender in this series of defeats

[Chorus]
Onward to the singularity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
Turn on this unentity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
We are faithless by default
We are faithless by default

A pain far too familiar
Denounce your savage self
Go

[Chorus]
Onward to the singularity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
Turn on this unentity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
We are faithless by default
We are faithless by default
Faithless by default

[Verse 1]
At a certain point it happens
Life becomes to real
And nothing can hold back
What is about to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know how close we need to get
To blind out the surroundings and focus on the real

[Chorus]
I know you're gone
But this reality is crashing down on me
Crashing down to defeat all purpose
I know you're gone
I'm just not ready I'm just not done
I am ever in resistant disbelief

[Verse 2]
When raw emotion gets in
The way of our throughts and words
We pass so far beyond our breaking point

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know how far we need to be
From all that we don't want to see
To regain perspective

[Chorus]
I know you're gone
But this reality is crashing down on me
Crashing down to defeat all purpose
I know you're gone
I'm just not ready I'm just not done
I am ever in resistant disbelief

[Bridge]
I know, yet I fail to find purpose and form
I know, but the truth just makes it harder

[Chorus]
I know you're gone
But this reality is crashing down on me
Crashing down to defeat all purpose
I know you're gone
I'm just not ready I'm just not done
I am ever in resistant disbelief

[Verse 1]
What if this image was taken
In an instant erased from the world
What if the truth is too far
And you reality can't cope with the distance
In the abstract a mind never challenged
Is the bearer of merciless fate

[Chorus]
All you can feel is the loss of who you are
By force or by fire, by force or by flame
All you will know is the void of emptiness
By force or the flame 'til reason prevails

[Verse 2]
When the doubt starts to creep in your mind
And subverts the true cause of your ways
You must remain a witness of merciless fate

[Chorus]
All you can feel is the loss of who you are
By force or by fire, by force or by flame
All you will know is the void of emptiness
By force or the flame

[Bridge]
All that you see is a darkness
From the outside looking in(2x)
All you can sense is surface tension
From a distance grasping at straws (2x)

[Chorus]
All you can feel is the loss of who you are
It's not about you, it's not about you
All you will know is the void of emptiness
By force of the flame, this merciless fate[Verse 1]
Despite what is out there burning
Our faces remain intact
We hear the screaming of the voiceless
Yet we are numb to the pain of others
We filter out the light
It never penetrates our blinding screens
We can take a stand

[Chorus]
But in the end it all means nothing
We rage out but we are wasting away
From the roots below
To the boundless stars above
We are nothing at all

[Verse 2]
What separates us from the others
A difference in choices made
We take an insignificant stance
What would we do in a opinion vaccuum
When left unaccountable
So here we are far from the world
Just wasting away

[Chorus]
Doing nothing being nothing
We are the favoured design
And we're wasting away
From the caves and embers
To the heart of the beyond
We are nothing at all

[Bridge]
Here we are doing nothing
Being nothing
We are wasting away

[Outro]
From the roots below
To the boundless stars above
We are nothing at all
Just wasting away[Verse 1]
Lonely path across the marshland (Marshland)
Leads to a forlorn grey lodge (Grey lodge)
Grey like the misery
Empty, abandoned
For the lone dweller is now gone
Ailment and poverty was her lot
Only guest ever the nightly frost that crept inside
Brief were the moments of bliss and gladness
For on this hoar peatland no joy will live

[Chorus]
And bells, they toll
In cold morning light
And bells, they toll
In bleak morning light

[Verse 2]
Once there was a fleeting time
When sky was less dark for a while
And the one that she adored
Walked her across the churchyard
Flowers bloomed and bells, they tolled
Hopeful was the spring's tone
But on this barren marshland
No gladness will ever last

[Bridge]
Here the nightly frost will creep inside the hearts
Here the brittle flowers will die before their time
And soon came the day when bells, they tolled again
For her dearest one, beneath the stones now lies
Under the churchyard sleeps
Under the churchyard sleeps

[Chorus]
And bells, they toll (Bells, they toll)
In cold morning light
And bells, they toll (Bells, they toll)
In bleak morning light

[Verse 1]
I rue the day
The day I turned the tides
I made a grave mistake
Left from your side

[Chorus]
Now, now I am lost in the shadows' lap
Straying on this downward road
Now I am left, I am left, I am left in the woods of woe
Roaming these twilight trails

[Verse 2]
You asked me to stay
But I closed the gate behind me
Bright lights beyond the trees
The gleam above the skyline
In vain I tried to reach
In vain I sought

[Chorus]
Now, now I am lost in the shadows' lap
Straying on this downward road
Now I am left, I am left, I am left in the woods of woe
Roaming these twilight trails

[Post-Chorus]
And too late I comprehend
It was just illusion
I've spent all those years chasing
Something I once had
Long time ago

[Bridge]
I cannot find my way home
I cannot find the way to you anymore
I cannot find my way home
I cannot find the way to you

[Refrain]
With a black shroud over my eyes
I don't see the skies or the earth
I don't see if the moon will die
Or the sun turns cold

[Verse 3]
A dreary path that weaves down below
Into the hidden abyss of the evenfall
And here I stand on the darkened shore
Forgotten man at the edge of the world
For what is there left for me anymore
But to languish and slowly fade away?
Regret and penance only friends by my side
When I sink into the void of the night
I lapse (I lapse)
Descend alone
I lapse (I lapse)
Descend alone

[Refrain]
With a black shroud over my eyes
I don't see the skies or the earth
I don't see if the moon will die
Or the sun turns cold          

Burnt sage in my lungs where i find you
Hiding in a drawer like candy
I want to go where you go
Untie our hands
Cut through the cord
Teeth are knives
Glare like perfect swords
I want to go where you go
Dying fox mountain witch
You gave me a quiver made of stag skin
Then sent me away in the moonlight
But i want to go where you go

Can you hear me when you're sleeping?
I can swear i see you inside my eyes
Feel you creeping in the shadows
I think i'll fall into them
Swallow my heart
Cut out the rest
Meet me again
Can you hear me when you're sleeping?
I can swear i see you always

[Verse 1]
Dark stone, moss grown
I was a wall in me
Blood-handed, climbing trees
Foss cliff, deep trip
I am the roaring wind
Swallowing all that I am

[Chorus]
All of the hills I’ve lied in
Pulling the tall grass inward
There was a stillness I’ve known
For a thousand lives
So many hearts like embers
Spit from the fire
But yours is mine
But yours is mine

[Verse 2]
Dark stone, seeds sown
Pouring my blood into
The soil I’m walking through
Dark stone, half moon
It’s like I never die
Claw through
Come back to life

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
All of the hills I’ve lied in
Pulling the tall grass inward
There was a stillness I’ve known
For a thousand lives
So many hearts like embers
Spit from the fire
But yours is mine
But yours is mine

[Outro]
But yours is mine
But yours is mine
But yours is mine
But yours is mine

[Chorus]
I remember you dragging me into the woods, hands out
Taste the soil fill up my mouth
Keep you alive in me under the ground
The crow in my heart
I remember

[Verse 1]
You are the hands the cover up the tracks we left
You are catching the orbs we met, glowing

[Chorus]
I remember you dragging me into the woods, hands out
Taste the soil fill up my mouth
Keep you alive in me under the ground
Crow in my heart

[Post-Chorus]
All of the darkness looks alive here
Burning me up when you aren't near
I'll close my eyes and fall into the fire
All of the darkness was alive

[Verse 2]
Wading, like dust in the blades of light
I am the flame that licks at the air like it won the fight

[Chorus]
I remember you dragging me into the woods, hands out
Taste the soil fill up my mouth
Keep you alive in me under the ground
GlowingIt's cold tonight
Do you feel bold tonight?
The wind licking at my face in the moonlight
Infinite blanket of sky, empty and black
Yawning over us

I feel like my head is numb
I feel like my lungs are stone
I feel like my veins are pumping tar
I can taste it
Lay me down in the tall grass
Bury my hands softly always

You are not alone
You are death and bloom
You are home
Let me melt with you
Let me melt with you
Let me melt with you
