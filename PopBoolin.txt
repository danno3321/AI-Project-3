[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Bridge]
I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (Love of my life)

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

Never know when someone comes and tries to take my life
I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got "Malone" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Verse 2]
Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky
No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides?

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Bridge]
(Ayy) Mind is runnin' all day
Cost me more than money and I'm payin' the price, yeah
I ain't goin' nowhere
Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah
Minute after minute, never had a limit
Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it
Either way, I know they'll come for me again

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace[Intro]
Ahahah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
When you leave me, make me jump up off my roof
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't never met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool?
Need to quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my woman for some diamonds and a coupe

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah

And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, yeah, yeah
Just to show you that it's over
It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah
I'ma put that bitch pussy in a motherfuckin' bodybag
So you know that I'm never ever coming back
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Beggin' on my knees onto the floor
Now, I don't even want you anymore, anymore
It's over now
It's over now, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
Feels like a knife in my throat, you treat this like it's a joke
I bet you've done this before, I ain't surprised, yeah
I wasn't tryna let go, but you'll know why when I'm ghost
I hope you wind up alone, dead in my eyes, yeah
Ain't religious, only Christian when it's Dior
Only prayin' for the Amex and the gold
You ain't stop me, no, you only was a detour
Tried to drive me crazy, you ran out of road

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended

Memories
Don't you ever let them fool you

You shouldn’t be on your high horse, we’re not so stable anymore

I wanna feel like I can't come down
I got a dream so I can’t stop now
I wanna, I wanna fly right now
I wanna see all my homies get down
I wanna feel like I can't come down
I got a dream so I can't stop now
I gotta stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest thing is believing in your dreams
Stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest thing is believing in your dreams

[Post-Chorus]
I feel like a stranger to myself
And sometimes that feels dangerous but I’ll bet you'll see me
For who I truly am, maybe not if it wasn't bland
Some days I look in mirrors and I wonder who's that man
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah

[Verse]
All my people gather 'round, I'm here to inspire (True)
If you runnin' on E, I'll put the fire in your lighter (Yeah)
Black Hollywood never started and it’s over
People only care when you’re Denzel or Oprah (Yeah)
Kosher, holster, make my homies bolder (Woo)
When your fear's near, you don’t wanna get closer (No)
Rappers sound the same so they chains gettin' colder (Yeah)
Women, claim your boy for some credit and some doja (Hey)
Hold up, that's just how we make it (Yeah)
Black never breaks so your patience gotta face it (Damn)
Know my life matter, but my matter keep on achin' (True)
This a warning, never conforming (No)

[Chorus]
I wanna fly right now
I wanna see all my homies get down
I wanna feel like I can’t come down

I wanna feel like I can't come down
I got a dream so I can't stop now
I gotta stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest thing is believing in your dreams
Stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest feeling is believing in your dreams

[Outro]
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah[Chorus 1]
I been waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you
One hundred bottles of the good shit couldn't even bring you back
What am I to do?
Feel like I'm circlin' a drain, all I see is the remains of an ugly truth (Of an ugly truth)
One hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back, but they can't replace you (They can't replace you)

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 1]
I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought that you'd go and do me dirty
Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin'
But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone
(And I ain't dead yet)

[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Chorus 2]
I'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you (Take me right to you)
One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back
What am I to do? (What am I to do?)
You’re my alibi and motive when I'm lyin' to myself, what an ugly truth (What an ugly truth)
We’re no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same if we make it through (And we can make it through)

[Verse 2]
My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah, it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the tables turned
I remember back then
Played my cards right you were my best hand
Still you keep me guessin'
Wonder if I'll ever get the message

[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Outro]
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm not scared of the dark
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
I'm not scared, not at all
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?
I'm not scared
I'm not scared, neither are the stars
I'm not scared of the dark
Of the dark, mmm

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi
I ain't never scared and I ain't never horrified
I just look down at my Rolex, it said it's the darkest times
I ain't never terrified, I ain't never petrified
You know I see dead people, I just tell 'em, "Get a life"
I ain't never scurred, I'm not sure if that's a word, but
I mean every word, feelin' like "do not disturb," wait
Let me testify, I have never testified
And I'm married to my pride, I ain't never, never cried
I got eyes like marbles, if I cry they sparkle
You know I can read your mind like I'm the author
There's a line for tomorrow and that line's gettin' shorter
I'm behind the trigger, what if I am the target?
Deep sigh, a sayōnara, I ain't afraid to die
It's either goodbye or good mornin', and the skies start to fallin'
And I'ma shine in the darkness
I look back down at my Rollie, it says "Time for the chorus"
You know I'm not scared

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Lil Wayne]
I'm not scared of the dark
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared, not at all
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared, neither are the stars
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared of the dark
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
Of the dark, mmm
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Yeah, yuh
Okay, put my heart to the side
In my feelings, ***, let's ride
Big MAC to the side
If she call, I'm gon' slide
"That my baby," boy, you crazy
She might get a new Mercedes
She say she want me, oowee
Okay, lil' shawty, let's do this, come on

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION]
If I could count the tears I've cried
A million times, I swear I've died
I'm trying, but it's still not right
The only time I want her is tonight

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Lil Wayne]
I'm not scared of the dark

I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall

Because of you, I have a purpose
Fight for the world because you're worth it

Sometimes I don't really know myself

Got a devil on my left and a angel on my right
I'm just tryna live my life, I'm just hangin' in the fight (Yuh)
Swingin' off the web of life, glidin' through the breeze (Breeze)
My uncle always told me that it never would be easy (Nah)
Now I'm lookin' to the sky hoping that he rest in peace

Very rarely do you catch me out
Y'all done "specially invited guest"'d me out
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, "Let's be out"
I was off the chain, I was often drained
I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame
I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame

Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained
All of you Mario, it's all a game

Peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me)
At times, wonder my purpose
Easy than to feel worthless
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me, with me)
Had so much on my mind, I didn't know where to go
I've come a long way from them hauntin' me
Had me feelin' oh so low

Oh, things ain't like before
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
No stress yes, I'm so blessed and-

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Outro]
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were—
—instead of my head
You found another— better one
I won't let you forget me[Intro]
Feels so good
Feels so right
And you always knew
I would get it right

[Chorus]
Let me show you how
How we get down
It's in my genes
To remove them jeans (Azure)
Let me show you how
How we get down
I'll keep this blunt
I'mma hit it like a blunt (Azure)

[Verse 1: Kero]
Now I don't know what you thinking about me
Apologies I've been M.I.A
AND ALL I WANNA DO IS, TO FOLLOW UP ON YOU, BUT I’M CAUGHT UP PAYING DUES
WHAT CAN I SAY..

LOVING HOW QUICKLY YOU SWERVE OTHER DUDES
WHO BE FLASHIN HIGH FASHION ACTIN SUPERIOR
I keep it casual, rockin' boyfriend material
JUST A PISCES, YOU MAY KNOW
IMAGINATION RUN LIKE HUSSAIN BOLT
IMAGINING YOU SING LIKE T-PAIN’S SOUL
ONE TINY DESK AND MY WUTANG HOLD

GIMME UR HAND SO I CAN TAKE YOU AWAY
THOUGH I LEFT SF FOR LA
I'M STILL SAN JO, YOU CAN CALL ME YOUR BAY AYE

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Azure]
SO TELL ME HOW YOU LAUGH AT THE FREAKS, TELL ME HOW YOU WHIP AND DANCE IN THE STREETS
TELL ME HOW YOUR MAN DONT EVER PUT HIS HAND ON YOUR KNEES WHEN YOUR SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT
OH I HEARD YOUR LOOKING FOR LOVE IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES AND YOU GET STUCK WITH ALL THE WRONG GAZES
BUT GIRL I’MMA SHOW YOU HOW TO REVERSE THE PAIN WITH AN OLD SCHOOL SOUND
HE CAN MAKE IT RAIN BUT I CAN ROLL YOU CLOUDS (WEED) AND LET YOUR INTELLECT ELECTROCUTE ME
YOU DONT GIVE ME VIBES THATS EXTRA GROUPY SO I AINT FOCUSED ON WETHER YOUR LEGS SALUTE ME
CAUSE I KNOW THE SEX AINT GON’ KEEP YOU AROUND

BUT IF YOU GOT TRUST I’LL MAKE SURE ITS MUTUAL AND YOU AINT GOTTA BE A BAD BITCH TO BE BEAUTIFUL..

[Chorus]
Let me show you how
How we get down
It's in my genes
To remove them jeans
Let me show you how
How we get down
I'll keep this blunt
I'mma hit it like a blunt[Verse 1]
I'm not the best at showing my emotions
You cut me deep and you left me wide open
I fought the demons that lie in between us
They'd think we're perfect if they'd ever seen us, but
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

[Chorus]
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada

[Verse 2]
I took the time to think of what you said
You were tap-dancing in my head
I must be honest, I have a lot of pride
But I'm broken inside
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

[Chorus]
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Woke up a little too late this morning
But I think I'll be okay
I'll be okay
Damn, my car still smells like marijuana
My mom is gonna kill me
Gonna kill me
Traffic's backed up from corner to corner
So I guess I'll hit the highway
The highway
Shake away all the stress off my shoulders
Gonna have a good day
A good day

[Chorus]
Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
It’s me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

[Verse 2]
No I've never really been the smartest
Yeah I've made my mistakes
My mistakes
You were there when times were at their darkest
Always showing me the way
Lead the way
Your love seems to cut me deep, the sharpest
You'll always have a part of me
A part of me
Losing you has always been the hardest
I wish it were the old days (oh I wish it were the old days)

[Chorus]
'Cause I was eighteen
And I still lived with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours were more understanding
I never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
When we did all the stupid shit that young kids do
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

You, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey…hey

Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
It’s me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
The curtains drawn, shawty X-rated
You're purpose-grown, the world's greatest
I see no flaws, so let's face it (huh)
No Roseanne Barr, despite the ratings
She's independent (huh), I'm willing to spend it
Let me book the flight (boss), [?] the night
Before we turn the page so many quotes that I like
You inspire so much that I write
She's my van Gogh, such a work of art
This where my love lies in this sensitive heart
So what's your name? Tell me your number
This such a cold game, you all I want this summer

[Chorus: Khalid & Normani]
So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe, mmm
I need a lover to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life
For my whole lifetime

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it (you ain't with it)

So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

[Verse 3: Normani]
I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history?
Are you into me?
When it feels so good, but it's bad for you
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do
Come on over, I need your company
Cravin' that synergy

[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it (you ain't with it)
I see you're focused, yeah, you're so independent (independent)
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)

You tryna make a move
Tonight I got the time, tell me what you wanna do
Call the squad if you wanna rendezvous
They gon' push up on they own, I only got room for two
From the 'jects on the set, it's a Porsche, not a 'Vette
I confess, I'ma flex till they show some respect
Get away so we can make sense of your life
You was in park but I just put your shit in drive

Can learn a lot from this and that's something that I know

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Bridge]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Outro]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter (Fighter)
'Cause all my life, I've been fighting
Never felt a feeling of comfort, oh
And all this time, I've been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence

[Chorus]
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

[Drop]
I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long

[Verse 2]
I'm in need of a savior (Savior), but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

[Chorus]
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

[Drop]
I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long[Verse 1: Khalid]
Tell me what you're crying for
I'll wipe your tears, oh love
If your soul is aching love
I'll comfort you for sure
If we're caught in a wave
I will carry you over
It don't matter where you are
I'll run to your front door

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm 100 with you

[Chorus: Khalid]
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could put an

[Drop: Khalid]
Between our love, love, love, love, love
You could put an
Between our love, love, love, love, love
You could put an ocean

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Shadows play on idle hands
I lose myself I do
But I've found my way to velvet sands
I'll crash right into you
If we're caught in a wave
I will carry you over
It don't matter where we are
You're still the one I choose

[Chorus: Khalid]
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could put an

[Drop: Khalid]
Between our love, love, love, love, love
You could put an
Between our love, love, love, love, love
You could put an ocean[Verse 1: Jamie Scott]
Light 'em up, light 'em up
Tell me where you are, tell me where you are
The summer nights, the bright lights
And the shooting stars, they break my heart

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jamie Scott]
I'm calling you now, but you're not picking up
Your shadows so close if you are still in love
Then light a match, light a match
Baby, in the dark, show me where you are

[Chorus: Jamie Scott]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day when I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away

[Post-Chorus: Jamie Scott]
So far away

[Verse 2: Romy Dya]
It's breaking me, I'm losing you
We were far from perfect, but we were worth it
Too many fights, and we cried, but never said we're sorry
Stop saying you love me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Romy Dya]
You're calling me now, but I can't pick up
Your shadow's too close, and I'm still in love
The summer's over now, but somehow, it still breaks my heart
We could have had the stars, oh

[Chorus: Jamie Scott & Romy Dya / Jamie Scott]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day when I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away

[Post-Chorus: Romy Dya /  Romy Dya & Jamie Scott]
So far away
So far away
Oh, so far away
So far away

[Outro: Romy Dya]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day when I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day when you're so far away[Letra de "Shawn Mendes - Youth ft. Khalid (Traducción al Español)"]

[Verse 1: Mikey]
Spot a little hottie when I flipped out the shade
Lookin' like a red Rari sittin' in a driveway
Bottle of Cîroc with a hint of Kool-Aid
She done pulled up like I'm getting rid of weeds
Are you tired from running through my mind?
Take a break and we can have a good time
Show you moves like I'm the new James Brown
Me and you should get a room right now

[Pre-Chorus: Mikey]
'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away
You're worth more than every single chain
It ain't gon' work if you don't want it to
Best drink I take is when I'm sippin' you

[Chorus: Mikey]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classy, come through with that magic
You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true

[Verse 2: Mikey]
I can take you to the room or I can take you to the beach
But we gotta leave at 9 'cause I gotta get my sleep
You can be the early bird, I'ma give you that worm
Get with me, I'll take you 'round the world

[Pre-Chorus: Mikey]
'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away
You're worth more than every single chain
Walk with a limp, it just means I'm cool
Next trip I take, it's just me and you

[Chorus: Mikey]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classy, come through with that magic
You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat
You said you livin' up north when you comin' to the A
You said you need to find a crib, well, tell me where you wanna stay
I know we're not too pressed for time but can you pick up on the pace
I'm tired of looking at your pictures, wanna be up in your face
I wanna dance with you, I wanna laugh, I wanna sing
Take you on the road, have you rockin' on my bling
Don't know if you're the one, but if you are, you'll get a ring
That's later down the line, don't wanna rush these types of things
I'm a mama's boy so you gotta meet my mama first
As you whip the Coupe around, just use the seat belt first
New shoes, new clothes and a Chanel purse
Vacaying in The Hamptons got a lazy curse
Lil Boat

[Chorus: Mikey]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classy, come through with that magic
You know that I'm 'bout to smash it, it's true[Verse 1]
What if, what if we run away?
What if, what if we left today?
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
And what if, what if we're hard to find?
What if, what if we lost our minds?
What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof

[Chorus]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

[Verse 2]
What if, what if we start to drive?
What if, what if we close our eyes?
What if we're speeding through red lights into paradise?
Cause we've no time for getting old
Mortal body; timeless souls
Cross your fingers, here we go

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof

[Chorus]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

[Outro]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
My youth is yours
My youth is yours[Verse 1]
Shine on, diamond

From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos

[Verse 1]
Huh, yeah
I'm keepin' it real, real
I'm keepin' it real, uh, yeah
Life gets tough, shit is getting real (Yeah)
I don't know how to feel
Swallowing all these pills
Numb my real feels, uh
Devil standing here
Tryna' make a deal, uh
It ain't no deals
Feel like I'm going crazy but still took a lot to get me here
Losing my sanity up in a house in the hills, hills, hills
I ain't have anything then and I still don't have anything still, still, still, uh
Bein' me, I rock, PnB
These hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ
These drugs acting like
Mosh pits squishing me
Oh my, oh me, how they kill me slowly
Lonely, I been gettin' no peace
OD, feel like overdosing
Low key I been looking for the signs
But all I can find is a sign of the times

I ain't suicidal
Only thing suicide is suicide doors
Fight for survival
Gotta keep hope up, rolling good dope up (Uh)
Hold my hand, through hell we go
Don't look back, it ain't the past no more
Gonna get to the racks, all them niggas want war
Yeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls
Exhale depression as the wind blows
These are the laws of livin' in vogue
We're perfectly imperfect children
Rose from the dust, all of us are on a mission
Never gave a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now we live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'
I don't give a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now I live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'

And spend every single moment with me daily, daily
Now you callin' me needy
Cuz you gotta work five times weekly

Tell me I'm buff when I'm flexing (Flex)

I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place (Mmm, nah)

Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Post-Chorus]
Figure out where we're goin'

[Interlude]
Can we just talk?
Before we get lost

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts

Talk[Verse 1]
Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Verse 2]
Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Bridge]
'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you
Nowhere like I do
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
Nowhere like I
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)[Intro]
Mmm, mmm
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
Don’t save me, I'm in no need of saving (Oh yeah)
And if you stay with me, I know you need patience (Yeah, yeah)
Blood and cologne on the fragrance (Mmm, yeah, yeah)
'Cause if ya deal with me, I know you know what pain is (Oh no)

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I’d hate for you to leave me attached

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
And I don't even like to think about it
On my own, but still so crowded
Walls come down and the guards come up
But there's nowhere to run, I feel surrounded
Hurt feels better when I'm by myself
No one really means it when they're wishing you well
I got no one to call, no one
And people only love you when they're needing your wealth
Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan
Everybody acting like they give a damn
Where is everybody when you need a hand?
I've been burning rubber on the Michelin
Flying in the rain like I'm Superman
I could say I love it, but that just depends

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I’d hate for you to leave me attached

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck

The reflection never point the same way
ABBA on repeat, yeah
Diamonds like a dancing queen, so...

Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves

This is my only fear: that we become

Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Outro: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more[Verse 1]
Remember when we first met?
You said, "Light my cigarette"
So I lied to my mum and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss

[Chorus]
Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

[Verse 2]
Remember when you taught me fate?
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothin' on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hoping that things would change
But we went right back to your games

[Chorus]
Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

[Bridge]
And even if I run away
Give my heart a holiday
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Yeah, they always taste like you, you
Long nights, daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like you

[Chorus]
Headlights on me
(And even if I run away)
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
(Give my heart a holiday)
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
(You always leave me wanting more)
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
(I can't shake my hunger for)
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you[Verse 1]
Hunnid thousand for the chain and now my drop (Drop, drop)
When I pull out the garage, I chop my top (Top, top)

Now I'm alone, Ice Box, Omarion (Ooh)

Couldn't listen to advice 'cause I'm never wrong (Oh)
In the spotlight, but I'm on my own (Oh)
Now that you're gone (now that you're gone)

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael

Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you

Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

She said, "Love me" so I love her
She said, "Leave me" so I left
Then I went to California
And I ain't never comin' back
I got a high five from a brother
I got bloodstains on the bed
And I ain't sayin' that I love her
But this bitch is gonna drive me mad
I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

The whole plane ride home
And I wish I could
I know I should leave you alone

I fell down to my knees
And when no one would accept ya
Throw myself up on a cross and bleed

But she rode me like no other
But this bitch is gonna drive me mad
I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

I know things don't feel the same
I've been drowning in my pain
Threw away the diamond ring
Don't you love it when it sting?

I know things don't feel the same
I've been drowning in my pain
I'll be sober
When it's over

[Verse]
Out my mind again, have I gone too far?
I done dropped the pen just to draw new scars
I got no regrets, didn't do no wrong
She ain't by my side, I'll be on my own

Searching for something, I'm searching for you
I feel so empty, what else can I do?
I get so faded, I'm crashing my coupe
I know you hate it when I'm loving you

Too much on my mind girl, I might die tonight
You be shining bright girl, tell another lie
I been feeling broken, keep it all inside
I been feeling broken, hard to say goodbye

[Chorus]
I know things don't feel the same
I've been drowning in my pain
Threw away the diamond ring
Don't you love it when it sting?

I know things don't feel the same
I've been drowning in my pain
I'll be sober
When it's over

I know things don't feel the same
I've been drowning in my pain
Threw away the diamond ring
Don't you love it when it sting?

I know things don't feel the same
I've been drowning in my pain
I'll be sober
When it's over[Intro]
Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

[Verse]
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home[Intro]
Ooh, yeah, yeah, hey

You'll never understand what my life is (My life is)

What you call a holiday (Ooh), I call another day (Yeah)
And I ain't ever stoppin', no apologies

[Chorus]
Such a long time (Such a long time)

[Chorus]
It’s what it is, it's how I live
All the places I've been

And I can't get enough
I wish I could've been there myself
(Wish I could've been there myself)

All of this American dreamin'
Everybody’s sick of believin'

All of this American dreaming
Oh, let's not give a fuck 'til
Giving a fuck has no meaning, oh

[Outro]
No, I can't get enough
Oh, oh, oh, oh[Verse 1]
Out of reach
Out of time
Maybe I'm too high
Out of mind
Out of line
Almost lost my sight
I don't know why I do this
I feel like I might lose you
Out of drugs, out of love (oh)
So let's compromise

[Pre-Chorus]
The floor is raising, the sky is falling
The tides are turning, my eyes are burning

[Chorus]
Head in the clouds
And I'm not coming down
I used to swim now I'm ready to sink
I wanna give you what I can not do
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Hate our haze
Different days
Maybe I'm too nice
In a maze, in a daze
How to read your signs
I knew that I was foolish
I was young and I was stupid
Never change, never take
There’s no compromise

[Pre-Chorus]
The floor is raising, the sky is falling
The tides are turning, my eyes are burning

[Chorus]
Head in the clouds
And I'm not coming down

Weʼre in the same boat cause we both had a bad day
I know itʼs hard but its gonna be okay
You ain't the only one out here feeling lonely
You ainʼt alone
You should know that youʼve got me
And I donʼt care what other people say
They were gonna talk anyway
So much drama in our face
A couple ways we can escape

[Chorus: Khalid]
I have a cabin in California
But The utilities are a couple months due
You have a house in Syracuse
Lets plan a road trip me and you

Cause they know about our history
Lets run away and leave our town behind us Lets run away just you and me
Just wanna runaway

[Verse 2: Tayla Parx]
You tell me
What's a storm without a little bit of lightning
What is love without a little bit of fighting
Canʼt believe that we're both unafraid to risk
Wait a minute
Are you really down for this?
Cause I'll be speeding if you tell me go
Tire screeching if you tell me no
Lets make freedom our favorite place
I'll fill the car up just incase

Ayy, I waited for you all day

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm headin' home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am over a thousand miles
Away, and I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin back, and sayin' "There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not sayin' that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times
Yeah, the pullin' out my hair, gettin' mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own"

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

[Chorus: H.E.R. & Ed Sheeran]
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30 minute conversation, "Boy, when you comin' home?
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own"
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin right now, but there will come a day when I won't

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran & H.E.R.]

I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, don't you turn off the light
Though I don't wanna leave you ever, no
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance," hey
You and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Ooh-my-my-my

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Paulo Londra]
I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Prr)
But they ain't got nothing on you (Ah, ah)
And you ain't got nothing on you (Leones Con Flow)

[Verse 2: Paulo Londra]
Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol, ah
Quiero comentarle que no sé qué pasó, ah
Desde que salimo' por la tarde lo' do'
A besarno' lo' do', hasta hacer el amor
Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
Lo que hacemo' lo' do' no se puede igualar
Parecemo' ficción cuando entramo' en acción
Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeh (Yo'; ¡wuf!)
Pero lo que mata e' que esta noche no' vemo' ya en mi casa (Ey; wuh)
Y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar

But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you

[Verse 3: Dave]
Look, take the lead, follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Home girl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
I fly in a spaceship, I gotta land the Rover
Casa Cruz, Casa Blanca, Casanova
I'm a fashionista, she in Fashion Nova
And a mad persona when I had her over
The outfit, it cost bread, I got the matching loafers
Why? 'Cause that's suttin' to do
I got a million and two but they're nothin' on you, nah

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Brrt)
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like "Damn¨

So join me in this bed that I'm in
And  push up on me and sweat, darling

Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

She got that, mm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That she really wants to know my name, hey

My grandma tell me that I still look young
But my little cousin thinks I'm turning thirty-one
You know she only six-and-three-months
And you can't forget the months
Got me missing what it meant to grow up, yeah
I used to air up my tires, ride my bike to the park
Capri Sun me with friends, play ball 'til it's dark
You know them sleepovers, yeah, where ain't nobody sleep
'Cause if you did, you'd get the sharpie on your cheek
Man, I'm talkin' like:
Back then, it's like we always had plans
Mama used to make me listen to them clean versions
And we'd rock with no girls at the middle school dance
We making beats with our pencils, even way back then
I'm talking, yeah
Man, we grew up sharing plates
Now we all living in different states
My little homie Tanner had a pool
His parents were hella cool
We couldn't wait until the last day of school

[Chorus]
I said:
"Baby, I'm good, I'm good
I ain't ever been better"
This summer won't break my heart
I won't let her
And, now that I'm older, I wanna be younger
Now that I'm wiser, I wanna be dumber
Now that I know what I know, and I've seen what I saw
I wish that I could be a kid in the summer (summer, summer, yeah)

[Verse 2]
It's like we fourteen, now we all growned up
Big high schoolers now, we all cell-phoned-up
I used to text my old girl 'til my minutes were up
The first time we all drank, we done all throwned up
I'm talking, yeah
A get together at the crib
His parents were out of town, got a ride from my friends
We had some girls come over, ain't nobody sober
That's the first day I figured out what hungover meant (shooby dooby doop)
You know
Back then, it's like we always had plans (shooby dooby doop)
Used to wake up late for school, so I rocked sweatpants (shooby dooby doop)
The only thing that made it better: if I had class with my friends (shooby dooby doop)
Aw damn, we didn't study -- we crammed
You know I'm talking 'bout the cheap beer and vodka
Kisses at the locker
Prom night was tight, but the pics were hella awkward
Yeah: smoking weed, spraying cologne
Parents ask how I am when I'm home

[Chorus]
I said:
"Baby, I'm good, I'm good
I ain't ever been better" (I ain't ever been better)
This summer won't break my heart (break my heart)

And, now that I'm older, I wanna be younger
Now that I'm wiser, I wanna be dumber (I wanna be dumber)
Now that I know what I know, and I've seen what I saw
I wish that I could be a kid in the summer (summer, summer, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Now, I'm thirty-five with a wife and a kid
Coming home to see my parents, we ain't spoke in a grip
We hit the local spot, coffee shop -- table at the front
I ain't gotta peep the menu, I know what I want already, yeah
And, as we saying goodbye, I think I see my homie outside
My childhood friend, growing up since I was ten:
"I ain't seen you in forever, Cole, how you been?"
He said: "Brother, I'm good, I'm good, I'm great
I ain't ever been better"
Yeah
This summer won't break my heart, it won't break my heart
I won't let her
Yeah, yeah
And now that I'm older, I wanna be younger
Now that I'm wiser, I wanna be dumber
Now that I know what I know, and I've seen what I saw
I wish that we could be some kids in the summer

[Chorus]
I said:
"Baby, I'm good, I'm good
I ain't ever been better"
This summer won't break my heart (It won't break my heart)
I won't let her, yeah
And, now that I'm older, I wanna be younger
Now that I'm wiser, I wanna be dumber
Now that I know what I know, and I've seen what I saw
I wish that we could be some kids in the--

I said:
"Baby, I'm good, I'm good, I'm great --

And, now that I'm older, I wanna be--
Yeah, I wanna be--

I wrote this song when I should've been taking notes
I'm in the back of the class and I got my hat real low
You know how that shit go
I ain't biting my tongue
Man, I'm just tryna touch bases like I hit a homerun
So put your middle fingers down to your thumb
And just let it snap like that
Yeah, bring it back that's a wrap, hold up (hey)
And I got a pretty girl on the east side
We both scared to love so she only comes at midnight
The good times
OK, but this is for the day when everybody love theyself
And ain't nobody wanna trade, and ain't nobody wanna leave
'Cause everybody wanna stay
And we do something so great
That we just popped champagne because we did it
I lost my childhood friend
He caught a case in high school and I ain't even seen him since
But like a period I'm waiting for your sentence to end
Joey, this one for the day when you free again

[Chorus: Devvon Terrell]
What a beautiful day and let's keep it that way
Let's save all the trouble and throw it away
So we can have a world that's all together today
If you with me let me hear you say, let me hear you say
If you can dance in the rain (dance in the rain)
It ain't no thing (it ain't no thing)
Just grab an umbrella (just grab an umbrella)
And find a song to sing (and find a song to sing)

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
Let's find a song to sing
And a bunch of dope drinks for us all to bring
I began as a peasant and became a king
I started from the bottom wouldn't change a thing
So can we toast to it?
I ain't made it all the way but I'm close to it
So clueless, don't judge until you go through it
World colder than a Frieza watch me Goku it
I wanna make it last
More laughs, more money, and more Breaking Bad
She know I rap so she shaking ass
But don't try so hard, you just make me laugh
But can she sit still
Me and Kid Quill are sort of like a big deal
Tell them haters, they can get real
On the days like this we can just chill

[Chorus: Devvon Terrell]
What a beautiful day and let's keep it that way
Let's save all the trouble and throw it away
So we can have a world that's all together today
If you with me let me hear you say, let me hear you say
If you can dance in the rain (dance in the rain)
It ain't no thing (it ain't no thing)
Just grab an umbrella (just grab an umbrella)
And find a song to sing (and find a song to sing)
What a beautiful day and let's keep it that way
Let's save all the trouble and throw it away
So we can have a world that's all together today
If you with me let me hear you say, let me hear you say
If you can dance in the rain
It ain't no thing
Just grab an umbrella
And find a song to sing

Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Gon' be)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (On me)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me (On me)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Instead of blaming all my old girls when I leave (What?)
Instead of calling up these fake hoes that I don't need (What?)
Old relationships turn to new déjà vus
Got me feeling like, "I don't fuck with you"
Oh nah, nah, that's the old me
You fucking with the new me (Yeah)
Honestly, all the disrespect had damn near ruined me (Damn near)
All the trust gone, seems like all you say is, "Prove it to me" (Straight)
And you know I suck at lying, don't, don't do it to me (Don't)
Maybe 'cause my mom had never worked it out with my dad (Damn)
Maybe 'cause he had insecurities and she had 'em back (Uh-huh)
Maybe 'cause single parent love was all I ever had
Who knows? (Who knows?)

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, Big Sean]
I'm single again (Single again)
Told her we'll be better off friends (Off friends)
Maybe I should just focus on me (On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again (Single again)
Told 'em that we better off friends (Off friends)
Blaming you is just so easy (Uh-huh)
But maybe the problem's me (Straight up)
I'm single again (Single again)
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Yeah, yeah)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (On me)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me

[Post-Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time
Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Even if I'm late, I'ma take my time

[Verse 2: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign]
What have you done for yourself?
What have you done for your mental health? (Yeah, yeah)
I even tried the drugs and they didn't help
Short term fix, that breaks everything else (Oh, oh)
And my bros keep throwing me these random girls in stallions
I need the best advice, went across the street to Khaled (Oh)
He said the major key is to be strong on your own
Lose your other half, you're never off balance (Oh)
Lookin' for the love in somebody else
That I probably should've gave to myself
Cycles I need to break in myself
If I'm alone, I'm second to no one else, so (Yeah)

[Chorus: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm single again (Oh)
Told her we'll be better off friends (Better off friends)
Maybe I should just focus on me (On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again
Told 'em that we better off friends (Oh, yeah)
Blaming you is just so easy (Oh)
But maybe the problem's me (Ooh)
I'm single again
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Way)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (Way)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me (Ooh)

[Post-Chorus: Big Sean]
Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Even if I'm late, I'ma take my time

[Outro: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign]

I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

[Verse 1: Lauv]
Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think that they make anything that strong, so I hold on
I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home

Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on
I, I, oh I
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzzcut Season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you, but I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv & Troye Sivan]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs (Someone take me home)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home ('Cause I can't be alone)
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs ('Cause I'm so tired)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home (Tired of love, tired of love)
Wanna go home, woah (Tired of love)[Intro]

I fell for your magic, I tasted your skin
And though this is tragic, at least I found the end
I witnessed your madness, you shed light on my sins
And if we share in this sadness, then where have you been?

[Chorus]
I know you're not in love like you used to be
Guess I’m not the one, like you used to think
So you just run
I know that I'm stuck in this misery
Guess I'm not enough, like you used to think
So I’ll just run (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
You bathe in your victory
You blew out on my fuse
And if I took on the planet
Will I pay my dues?
Your love was a mystery
Yeah, my love is a fool
And I travel the country just to get to you

I know you're not in love like you used to be

Me and J take over and we way up
Now high above the city of angels
Smoke a boge in the sky, pass the fuego

Only came to the club 'cause they paid us
Take this shit and lemme see what you made of
No sleep, little mama, we gon' stay up
Vampires on a night in Las Vegas

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (oh yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (ah)
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly (slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinking (oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (remember)

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', "Everybody's famous!"
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me

Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' llello to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly

Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer

I ain't even see the face, but she got beautiful boobies (Wow)
And she see those diamonds in my teeth (In my teeth)
